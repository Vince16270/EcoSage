    "# Blue Scores\n",
    "\n",
    "In eerste instantie hebben we het model geëvalueerd met klassieke metriek zoals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exact Match (EM): geeft alleen een score van 1 als het modelantwoord exact gelijk is aan de referentie. In ons geval was deze 0%.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Word Overlap: gemiddeld slechts 28.76%, wat suggereert dat het model vaak andere woorden gebruikte dan in de referenties.\n",
    "\n",
    "- BLEU: een populaire metriek in machinevertaling, maar de score was gemiddeld 0.48%, wat erg laag is.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ROUGE-1 (F1): had een gemiddelde van slechts 6.55%, wat wijst op beperkte n-gram overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deze scores gaven ons het signaal dat het model misschien inhoudelijk goed was, maar niet in exact dezelfde bewoordingen als de referentie.\n",
    "\n",
    "BERTScore biedt een alternatief dat semantiek begrijpt, in plaats van puur naar woord-overlap te kijken. Het gebruikt de werking van BERT (een voorgetraind taalmodel van Google) om te meten hoe semantisch gelijk twee zinnen zijn.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Voordelen van BERTScore:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Begrijpt de betekenis achter verschillende woorden.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Houdt rekening met synoniemen en parafrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Past goed bij open vragen of natuurlijke taal antwoorden.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wat doen we in dit deel?\n",
    "We berekenen de BERT F1-score tussen het modelantwoord en elk van de 5 referenties afzonderlijk. Daarna pakken we de hoogste score per rij, en berekenen daar het gemiddelde van voor een beter algemeen beeld van de prestaties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zo kunnen we eerlijker beoordelen hoe goed het model inhoudelijk antwoord geeft, los van exacte bewoording."
