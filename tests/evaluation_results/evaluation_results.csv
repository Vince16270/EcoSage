8,What is the 'Farm to Fork' strategy and how does it promote a sustainable food system?,"The 'Farm to Fork' strategy is a European Union initiative aimed at creating a more sustainable food system by 2030. The strategy focuses on reducing the environmental impact of the food chain, promoting sustainable agriculture, and ensuring food safety. It aims to reduce the use of pesticides, improve animal welfare, reduce food waste, and increase the consumption of plant-based diets. By implementing these measures, the EU hopes to improve the health of consumers, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and protect biodiversity. The strategy also aims to create a more resilient and competitive food sector that can adapt to climate change and other challenges. Overall, the 'Farm to Fork' strategy is an important step towards building a more sustainable and resilient food system in the EU.",0.4,0.4,0.9,0.2,0.4,0,0,0,0,0,Targets a 50 % reduction in chemical pesticides and a 20 % cut in fertiliser use by 2030.,Aims to boost EU organic farming share to 25 % of agricultural land.,"Sets measures to improve animal welfare, including better housing and transport standards.",Encourages shorter supply chains and fairer returns for farmers and fishers.,Seeks to halve per-capita food waste at retail and consumer levels by 2030.,8.5,5.8,7.4,1.5,8.8,40.0,33.3,41.7,10.0,46.2
11,How can I make my home more energy-efficient?,"To make your home more energy-efficient, consider the following measures:
1. Insulate your walls, attic, and floors to reduce heat loss.
2. Install energy-efficient windows and doors to prevent drafts and maintain a comfortable temperature.
3. Upgrade to energy-efficient appliances, such as refrigerators, washing machines, and air conditioners.
4. Use LED light bulbs and switch to smart power strips to reduce electricity consumption.
5. Seal air leaks around doors, windows, and other openings to prevent drafts and maintain a comfortable temperature.
6. Set your thermostat to energy-efficient settings and use programmable thermostats to optimize heating and cooling.
7. Plant trees and shrubs around your home to provide natural insulation and shade.
8. Use natural light and ventilation whenever possible to reduce reliance on artificial lighting and air conditioning.
9. Regularly maintain your home's heating and cooling systems to ensure they operate efficiently.
10. Educate yourself and your family about energy conservation practices and make conscious efforts to reduce energy consumption.
By implementing these measures, you can significantly reduce your energy consumption, lower your utility bills, and contribute to a more sustainable future.",0.4,0.0,0.3,0.2,0.2,0,0,0,0,0,"Install attic, cavity-wall and floor insulation to prevent heat loss.",Fit high-performance double or triple glazing with low-emissivity coatings.,"Seal gaps around doors, windows and pipe penetrations using weather-stripping and caulk.",Install a smart thermostat and zone controls to heat only occupied spaces.,Consider on-site renewables such as heat pumps or solar-thermal panels for hot water.,8.3,0.0,5.2,7.2,4.1,80.0,0.0,45.5,58.3,30.8
