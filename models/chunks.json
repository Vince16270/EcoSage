  ", managing their consump tion to deliver energy effic ient solutions which save them money and contr ibut e to the overall reduction of energy consum ption . ( 6 ) the commission communication of 15 july 2015 , entitled launching the public consultation process on a new energy mark et design , highlight ed that the mov e awa y from generation in large central generating installations towards decentralised production of electr icity from renewable sources and towards decarbonised mark ets requires adapting the current rules of electr icity trading and changing the existing mark et roles . the communi cation underlined the need to organise electr icity mark ets in a more flexible manner and to fully integrat e all mark et players including producers of renewable energy , new energy service provid ers , energy storag e and flexible demand . it is equally important for the union to invest urgently in interconnection at union level for the transfer of energy through high-vo ltage electr icity transmission systems . ( 7 ) with a view to creating an internal market for electr icity , member state s should foster the integration of their national markets and cooperation among system operat ors at union and regional level , and incor porate isolate d system s that form electr icity islands that persist in the union . ( 8 ) in addition to addressing new challenges , this directive seeks to address the persisting obstacles to the compl etion of the intern al mark et for electr icity . the refined regulator y framew ork needs to contr ibut e to overcoming the current problems of fragment ed national mark ets which are still often determined by a high degree of regulatory inter ventions . such interventions have led",
  "of the intern al mark et for electr icity . the refined regulator y framew ork needs to contr ibut e to overcoming the current problems of fragment ed national mark ets which are still often determined by a high degree of regulatory inter ventions . such interventions have led to obstacles to the supply of electr icity on equal term s as well as higher costs in compar ison to solutions based on cross-border cooperation and mark et-based principles . ( 9 ) the union would most effectively meet its renewable energy targets through the creation of a mark et framewor k that rewards flexibility and innovati on . a well-functioning electr icity mark et design is the key factor enabling the uptak e of renewable energy . ( 10 ) consumers have an essential role to play in achieving the flexibility necessar y to adapt the electr icity system to variable and distr ibuted renewable electr icity generation . technological progress in grid management and the generation of renewable electr icity has unlock ed many oppor tunities for consumers . healthy competiti on in retail mark ets is essential to ensur ing the mark et-dr iven deplo yment of innovati ve new services that address consumers ' changing needs and abilities , while increasing system flexibility . however , the lack of real-time or near real-time information provided to consumers about their energy consum ption has prevente d them from being active participants in the energy mark et and the energy transition . by empo wering consumers and providing them with the tools to participat e more in the energy market , including participating in new ways , it is intended that citizens in the union benefi t from the internal market for electr icity and that the",

( 11 ) the freedoms which the treaty on the functioning of the european union ( tfeu ) guarant ees the citizens of the union inter alia , the free mov ement of goods , the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provid e services are achievab le only in a fully open market , which enables all consumers freely to choose their suppliers and all suppliers freely to deliver to their custome rs . ( 12 ) promoting fair competition and easy access for different suppliers is of the utmost impor tance for member states in order to allow consumers to take full advantag e of the oppor tunities of a liberalised internal mark et for electr icity . nonetheless , it is possible that mark et failure persists in peripheral small electr icity system s and in system s not connecte d with other member state s , where electr icity prices fail to provide the right signal to drive investment , and theref ore requires specific solutions to ensure an adequate level of secur ity of supply . ( 13 ) in order to foster competition and ensure the supply of electr icity at the most competitive price , member states and regulatory author ities should facilitate cross-border access for new suppliers of electr icity from diffe rent energy sources as well as for new providers of generation , energy storag e and demand response . 14.6.2019",

  "( eu ) 2018/1999 of the european parliament and of the council ( 7 ) . ( 18 ) electr icity markets differ from other mark ets such as those for natural gas , for example because they involve the trading in a commodity whic h can not currently be easily stored and whic h is produced using a large variety of generating installations , including through distr ibut ed generation . this has been reflecte d in the different approac hes to the regulatory treatment of interconnect ors in the electr icity and gas sectors . the integrat ion of electr icity mark ets requires a high degree of cooperation among system operat ors , market participants and regulatory author ities , in particular where electr icity is traded via mark et coupling . ( 19 ) secur ing common rules for a true internal mark et and a broad supply of electr icity that is accessible to all should also be one of the main goals of this directive . to that end , undist orted mark et prices would provid e incentives for cross-border interconnections and for investments in new electr icity generation while leading to price conver gence in the long term . ( 20 ) mark et prices should give the right incentives for the development of the netw ork and for investing in new electr icity generation .

( 32 ) several factors impede consumers from accessing , understanding and acting upon the various sources of mark et information available to them . it follo ws that the compara bility of offers should be improved and barriers to switc hing should be minimised to the greatest practicable exte nt without unduly limiting consumer choice .

  "reduction target for net ghg emissions of at least 55 % by 2030 compared to 1990. the european council concluded that the climate ambition needed to be raised in a manner that would spur sustainable economic growth , create jobs , deliver health and environmental benefits for union citizens , and contribute to the long-term global competitiveness of the unions economy by promoting innovation in green technologies . ( 4 ) to implement those objectives , the commission , in its communication of 19 october 2020 on commission work programme 2021 a union of vitality in a world of fragility , announced a legislative package to reduce ghg emissions by at least 55 % by 2030 ( the fit for 55 package ) , and to achieve a climate-neutral european union by 2050. that package covers a range of policy areas including energy efficiency , renewable energy , land use , land change and forestry , energy taxation , effort sharing and emissions trading . ( 5 ) the purpose of the fit for 55 package is to safeguard and create jobs in the union and to enable the union to become a world leader in the development and uptake of clean technologies in the global energy transition , including energy efficiency solutions .

  "absorptions , and around 47 % , when including them . the climate target plan therefore provides for a set of required actions across all sectors of the economy and revisions of the key legislative instruments to reach that increased climate ambition . ( 7 ) in its communication of 28 november 2018 on a clean planet for all a european strategic long-term vision for a prosperous , modern , competitive and climate neutral economy , the commission stated that energy efficiency is a key area of action , without which the full decarbonisation of the unions economy can not be achieved . the need to capture the cost-effective energy saving opportunities has led to the unions current energy efficiency policy . in december 2018 , a new 2030 union headline energy efficiency target of at least 32,5 % , compared to projected energy use in 2030 , was included as part of the clean energy for all europeans package , which aimed at putting energy efficiency first , achieving global leadership in renewable energies and providing a fair deal for consumers . ( 8 ) the impact assessment accompanying the climate target plan demonstrated that , to achieve the increased climate ambition , energy efficiency improvements will need to be significantly raised from the current level of 32,5 % . ( 9 ) an increase in the unions 2030 energy efficiency target can reduce energy prices and be crucial in reducing ghg emissions , accompanied by an increase and uptake of electrification , hydrogen , e-fuels and other relevant technologies necessary for the green transition , including in the transport sector . even with the rapid growth of renewable electricity generation , energy efficiency can reduce the need of new power generation capacity and the costs relating to storage",
  "uptake of electrification , hydrogen , e-fuels and other relevant technologies necessary for the green transition , including in the transport sector . even with the rapid growth of renewable electricity generation , energy efficiency can reduce the need of new power generation capacity and the costs relating to storage , transmission and distribution . increased energy efficiency is also particularly important for the security of the energy supply of the union , by lowering the unions dependence on the import of fuels from third countries . energy efficiency is one of the cleanest and most cost-efficient measures by which to address that dependence . ( 10 ) the sum of national contributions communicated by member states in their national energy and climate plans falls short of the unions target of 32,5 % . the contributions would collectively lead to a reduction of 29,7 % for primary energy consumption and 29,4 % for final energy consumption compared to the projections from the commissions 2007 eu reference scenario for 2030. that would translate in a collective gap of 2,8 percentage points for primary energy consumption and 3,1 percentage points for final energy consumption for the eu-27.en official journal of the european union l 231/2 20.9.2023 ( 11 ) a number of member states presented ambitious national energy and climate plans , which were assessed by the commission as sufficient , and which contained measures that allow those member states to contribute to reaching the collective targets for energy efficiency with a ratio larger than the union average . in addition , a number of member states have documented early efforts in achieving energy savings , namely energy savings above the union average trajectories in the last years . both cases are significant efforts that should be recognised and should be included",
  "ratio larger than the union average . in addition , a number of member states have documented early efforts in achieving energy savings , namely energy savings above the union average trajectories in the last years . both cases are significant efforts that should be recognised and should be included in the unions future modelling projections and that can serve as good examples of how all member states can work on their energy efficiency potential to deliver significant benefits to their economies and societies . ( 12 ) in some cases , the assumptions used by the commission in its 2020 eu reference scenario and the assumptions used by some member states for their reference scenarios underpinning their national energy and climate plans are different . this may lead to divergences as regards the calculation of primary energy consumption but both approaches are valid with regard to primary energy consumption . ( 13 ) while the energy savings potential remains large in all sectors , there is a particular challenge relating to transport , as it is responsible for more than 30 % of final energy consumption , and to buildings , since 75 % of the unions building stock has a poor energy performance . another increasingly important sector is the information and communications technology ( ict ) sector , which is responsible for 5 to 9 % of the worlds total electricity use and more than 2 % of global emissions . in 2018 , data centres accounted for 2,7 % of the electricity demand in the eu-28 . in that context , the commission , in its communication of 19 february 2020 on shaping europe 's digital future ( the unions digital strategy ) , highlighted the need for highly energy-efficient and sustainable data centres and transparency",

( 14 ) the higher level of ambition requires a stronger promotion of cost-effective energy efficiency measures in all areas of the energy system and in all relevant sectors where activity affects energy demand , such as the transport , water and agriculture sectors . improving energy efficiency throughout the full energy chain , including energy generation , transmission , distribution and end-use , will benefit the environment , improve air quality and public health , reduce ghg emissions , improve energy security by decreasing the need for energy imports , in particular of fossil fuels , cut energy costs for households and companies , help alleviate energy poverty , and lead to increased competitiveness , more jobs and increased economic activity throughout the economy . improving energy efficiency would thus improve citizens quality of life , while contributing to the transformation of the unions energy relations with third- country partners towards achieving climate neutrality . that complies with the union commitments made in the framework of the energy union and global climate agenda established by the paris agreement . improving the energy performance of various sectors has the potential of fostering urban regeneration , including improvement of buildings , and changes in mobility and accessibility patterns , while promoting more",

( 15 ) this directive takes a step forward towards climate neutrality by 2050 , under which energy efficiency is to be treated as an energy source in its own right . the energy efficiency first principle is an overarching principle that should be taken into account across all sectors , going beyond the energy system , at all levels , including in the financial sector . energy efficiency solutions should be considered as the first option in policy , planning and investment decisions when setting new rules for the supply side and other policy areas . while the energy efficiency first principle should be applied without prejudice to other legal obligations , objectives and principles , such obligations , objectives and principles should not hamper its application or lead to exemptions from applying the principle . the commission should ensure that energy efficiency and demand response can compete on equal terms with generation capacity . energy efficiency improvements need to be made whenever they are more cost-effective than equivalent supply-side solutions . that should help exploit the multiple benefits of energy efficiency for the union , in particular for citizens and businesses . implementing energy efficiency improvement measures should also be a priority in alleviating energy poverty.en official journal of the european union 20.9.2023 l 231/3 ( 16 ) energy efficiency should be recognised as a crucial element and a priority consideration in future investment decisions on the unions energy infrastructure .",

  ". in particular , the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions from buildings , road transpor t and additional sectors which correspond to industr ial activities not covered by annex i to directive 2003/87/ec of the european parliament and of the council ( 6 ) within the scope of that directive should provide an additional economic incentive to invest in the reduction of fossil fuel consum ption and thereb y accelerat e the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions . combined with other measures , this should , in the medium to long term , contr ibute to the reduction of energy poverty and transpor t pover ty , reduce the costs of buildings and road transpor t , and , where relevant , provide new oppor tunities for quality job creation and sustainable investments , fully aligned with the goals of the european green deal .
