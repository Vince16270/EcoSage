# EcoSage - an LLM to find sustainable solutions

In this project, we focus on improving the accessibility of policy information related to the energy transition. Governments across Europe and the Netherlands publish numerous policy documents, regulations, and reports to support the shift toward renewable energy sources. These documents are often technical, extensive, and written in academic or legal language, making it difficult for citizens to understand their content. As a result, they miss out on important information about subsidies, regulations, or their own role in the energy transition.

To address this problem, we are developing a chatbot powered by a Large Language Model (LLM). This chatbot is capable of automatically analyzing, summarizing, and translating government documents into plain and understandable language. Users can ask questions through a simple interface, and the chatbot provides clear answers based on factual information.

Our approach consists of collecting policy documents in PDF format, preprocessing the texts using NLP techniques such as tokenization and filtering, and leveraging a powerful pretrained LLM for text processing. Instead of training a model from scratch, we utilize a pretrained model and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to generate relevant answers. The generated responses are evaluated based on their clarity, relevance, and reliability.

With this tool, we aim to contribute to a better-informed society in which citizens have easy access to simplified yet essential information. In doing so, we not only increase public engagement in the energy transition, but also strengthen support for sustainable policy.
