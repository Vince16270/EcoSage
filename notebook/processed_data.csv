COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN 
PARLIAMENT, THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL, THE COUNCIL, THE EUROPEAN 
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE OF THE 
REGIONS  
REPowerEU: Joint European Action for more affordable, secure and sustainable energy    
   
1 INTRODUCTION  
Following the invasion of Ukraine  by Russia , the case for a rapid clean energy transition  
has never been stronger and clearer.  The EU imports 90% of its gas consumption, with 
Russia providing  more than 40% of the EU’s total gas consumption . Russia also account s for 
27% of oil imports and 46% of coa l imports.

The EU needs to be  ready for any scenario . It can reach independence from Russian gas 
well before the end of the decade . The sooner and more decisive ly we diversif y our  supply , 
accelerate the roll out of green energy technologies  and reduce  our demand of energy , the 
earlier we can substitute Russian gas . This communication sets out new actions to ramp up 
the production of green energy, diversify supplies and reduce demand , focusing primarily 
on gas, which significantly influences  the electricity market  and where the global market 
is less liquid . The focus  can be extended  to phas ing out dependence on Russian oil and 
coal, for which the EU has a broader diversity of potential suppliers.  
Accelerat ing the green transition will reduce  emissions, reduce dependency on imported fossil 
fuels, and protect against price hikes.  Rising fossil fuel prices  hit energy -poor or vulnerable 
household consumers particularly hard, who spend a high share of their total income on energy 
bills1, exacerbating the disparities and inequalities in the EU. Businesses, in particular energy -
intensive industries, as well as the agri -food sector face higher production costs.  
Providing companies and households with affordable , secure  and clean  energy requ ires 
decisive action , starting immediately with price mitigation and storing gas for next winter.

2 I. ADDRESSING THE EMERG ENCY  
Very  high energy prices are hurting the economy . The European Central Bank estimate d 
before the invasion  that the energy price shocks will reduce GDP growth by around 0.5 
percentage points in 2022.  Continued high energy price s are likely to increase poverty  and 
affect business competitiveness. Energy -intensive industries in particular have faced higher 
manufacturing costs2. High energy prices also mean higher prices for other commodities, 
notably food . A combination of higher energy , transport  and higher food prices would 
exacerbate the pressure on low income households , with increased risks of poverty .  
The Commission’s toolbox3 of October 2021 has helped mitigate the impact of high energy 
prices.  The measures should be continued as long as necessary.  
To address the current emergency, the Commission will look into all possible options for 
emergency measures to limit the contagion effect of gas prices in electricity prices, such as 
temporary price limits. It will consult as a matter of urgency all concer ned actors and propose 
options in the coming weeks.  
The Commission will also assess options to optimise the electricity market design to reap 
the benefits from low cost energy. It will take into account the final report of the European 
Union Agency for th e Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER)  and other contributions  on 
the functioning of the electricity market  on benefits and drawbacks of alternative electricity 
pricing mechanisms . It will follow up as appropriate to keep electricity affordable without 
disrupting supply and further investment  in the green transition . 
1.1.Mitigating retail prices and supporting  heavily exposed companies  
The Commission confirms  that price  regulation and transfer mechanisms  to help protect 
consumers and our economy  are possible . The legal framework of the electricity market , and 
in particular Article (5) of the electricity Directive4, allows Member States , in the current 
exceptional  circumstances , to set retail  price s for households and micro -enterprises.   
The Commission provides  detailed guidance in Annex 1 to this Communication  to help 
Member States devise schemes for  regulated prices . This could be accompanied by incentives 
for energy efficiency and savings, to reduce energy bills.  
EU State aid rules offer Member States options to provide short -term relief to companies and 
farmers affected by high energy prices,  and help reduce their exposure to energy price volatility 
in the medium to long  term. For example, Member States can offer temporary relief for 
companies facing liquidity needs due to current high energy prices , regardless of their size, 
based on the guidelines on rescue and restructuring5. The Commission will treat those cases 
                                                           
2  Over half of the EU’s aluminium and zinc smelters are today operating at reduced capacity or have temporarily closed. 
The EU has temporarily lost 650 000 tonnes of primary aluminium capacity, a bout 30% of its total.

market for electricity and amending Directive 2012/27/EU  (OJ L158,  14.6.2019, p. 125 –199). 
5  Communication from the Commission - Guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restruc turing non -financial undertakings 
in difficulty (OJ C 249, 31.7.2014, p.1 ). The aid can be granted in the form of liquidity support (loans or guarantees) for 
a maximum duration of 6 months for large undertakings in difficulty, or up to 18 months for SMEs. Undertakings that 
are not in difficulty can also benefit if they face ‘acute liquidity needs due to exceptional and unforeseen circumstances’   
3 with priority  with special attention to gas utilities and intermediaries faced with increased 
supply costs due to contracts disruptions.  
The EU Emissions Trading System State aid Guidelines6 enable Member States to 
specifically support sectors that, are most at risk of carbon leakage because of  indirect emission 
costs . In the agricultural sector, State aid rules7 allow investment aid in sustainable 
energy. In the on -going  review  of th ose rules , the Commission’s proposal8 under  public 
consultation increases  the options to provide  support for farmers .  
The Commission is ready to use the full flexibility of its State aid toolbox in order to enable 
Member States to support companies and sectors severely impacted by the current geopolitical 
developments.  To enable Member States to rem edy the serious disturbance s to the economy  
resulting from Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine , the Commission will shortly be  
consulting Member States on  the needs for and scope of a new, self -standing  Temporary 
Crisis Framework9. Such a Framework  could for example  allow liquidity support for all 
undertakings directly or indirectly affected by the crisis and aid to undertakings10, in particular  
energy -intensive consumers , to compensate for part of their increase in energy costs due to the 
price shock since the Russian invasion . The Commission has  also consulted Member States on 
targeted amendments to the ETS State aid guidelin es, in particular to expand the list of eligible 
sectors, while ensuring that they are subject to reinforced incenti ves to improve energy 
efficiency and/or decarbonise their production and limiting competition distortions among 
Member States .  
To finance such emergency measures,  Member States can consider temporary tax 
measures on windfall profits. According to the International Energy Agency  such fiscal 
measures on high rents could make available up to EUR 200 billion in 2022 to partially offset 
higher energy bills11. Such measures should not be retroactive, but should be technologically 
neutral and allow electricity producers to cover their costs and protect long -term market and 
carbon price signals.  Annex 2 sets out the conditions those instruments should meet. Member 
States can also use  higher than expected  ETS revenues . From 1 January 2021 to 28 February 
2022, the revenues generated from the auctioning from EU ETS allowances amounted to 
around EUR 30 billion12.   
The Commission recalled in its Communication on fiscal guidance for 2023 that the so -called  
“general escape clause” of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) c ontinues to apply in

address social aspects in lower - and middle -income households.   
4 2022,  allowing Member States to take exceptional measures in the current exceptional 
circumstances.  
1.2. Preparing for next winter by e nsuring sufficient gas storage  
Gas supplies are sufficient until the end of this winter even in case of full disruption of 
supplies from Russia .  
In order to be well -prepared  for next winter , filling of gas storage across the EU should 
start now.  During the heating season, storage reduces the need to import additional volume. 
Storage contributes to absorbing  supply shocks. Gas storage supplies 25 -30% of gas consumed 
in winter. Gas storage levels have proven to be particularly low at sites owned by third country 
entities ( i.e. Gazprom). In parallel, t ransmission system operators should also coordinate 
measures  to update and optimise capacities available in the network in case of reduced or no 
flows and pressure from the East . 
The Commission will make a legislative proposal  by April  so as to ensure an  annual  adequate 
level of storage13. This proposal will require that existing storage infrastructures in the EU  
territory are filled up to at least 90%  of their capacity by 1 October each year . In order to make 
storage more attractive to market participants, the Commission will propose to increase the 
rebate level to 100% as an incentive to refill storage.  
An EU gas storage policy  will ensure fairness and allow making smart use of existing 
infrastructure, limiting the need for new infrastructure  as not all Member States have 
underground storage facilities in their territories . The legal proposal will set out a mechanism 
to ensure a fair allocation of security of supply costs . Indeed, t he benefits of having a 
guaranteed high filling level, in terms of the insurance value against security of supply risks 
and price dampening effects in winter are not limited to the country where the storage is 
located. Interconnectors are essential to ensu re the uninterrupted  energy flow within the whole 
EU. If new infrastructure is needed, it should be hydrogen compatible.  
In the light of the current geopolitical environment , the Commission envisages that this  legal 
proposal will identify gas storage as a critical infrastructure  and introduce provisions to 
tackle ownership risks  for gas infrastructure . Member State s will have to require the  
regulatory authority or another competent authority designated by the Member State  to certify 
that ownership  by a person or persons from a third country does not put at risk the security of 
supply . Such assessment will have to be done for all existing and future storage operators. In 
the short term  and pending the legislative process , Member States should act as if the 
legislation was already in place and take measures to ensure refilling of storage  in time for next 
winter.  Moreover, as foreseen by the existing Gas Security Supply Regulation14, they need to 
conclude solidarity arrangements.  Given the current contex t this  should be done without 
delay .  
To incentivise the refilling, Member States can provide aid to suppliers under Article 107(3)(c) 
TFEU for example in the form of guarantees ( ‘two-way contract for difference’ ).  
                                                           
13  13 Member States - BE, BG, DK, ES, FI, FR, HU, IT, LT, LV, PL, PT, SE have storage obligations in place. Others, e.g. 
DE announced plans to introduce them .  
14  Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2017 conce rning measures to 
safeguard the security of gas supply and repealing Regulation (EU) No 994/2010  (OJ L 280, 28.10.2017, p. 1 –56).   
5 For its part, t he Commission can coordinate  refilling operations , for example through  joint 
procurement, collecting orders and matching supplies. A joint European platform for 
contractuali sation of gas supply based on  bilateral negotiations with major gas producers would 
help diversification and smart risk management , hence ensuring security of supplies on 
favourable conditions for all buyers across the EU .  
The Commission  is also pursuing its investigation into the gas market  in response to  concerns 
regarding  potential  distortions of competition by companies active on the European gas 
markets , notably by Russian gas supplier Gazprom. The company displays unusual business 
behaviour, and the a verage filling level of EU Gazprom -operated storage is around 16% , 
wher eas non -Gazprom storage is at 44%.  The Commission is currently investigating as a matter 
of priority all allegations of potential  anti-competitive commercial conduct by Gazprom and 
gathering additional information from market players.   
The Commission continues to work with neighbours and partners in the Western Balkans, and 
in the Energy Community , which  share the EU’s fossil fuel dependencies and exposure to price 
hikes, while also having committed to t he same long term climate goals . For Ukraine , Moldova  
and Georgia , the EU stands ready to support to ensure reliable and sustainable energy as 
necessary. The ongoing effort to provide for an emergency synchronisation of the Ukrainian 
and Moldovan electricity grids with the continental Eur opean grid is a clear token of this 
commitment.  
 
II. REPOWER EU: ELIMINATING  OUR DEPENDENCE ON RUSSIAN 
FOSSIL FUELS   
Phasing out  our dependence on fossil fuels from Russia can be done well before 2030 . To 
do so,  the Commission  proposes a REPower EU plan that will increas e the resilience of  
the EU -wide energy system based on two pillars :  
 Diversifying gas supplies , via higher LNG imports and pipeline imports from non -
Russian suppliers,  and higher levels  of biomethane and hydrogen.  
 Reducing faster our dependence on fossil fuels at the level of homes , buildings  and 
the industry, and at the level of the power system by  boosting energy efficiency gains, 
increasing the share of  renewable and addressing infrastructure bottlenecks.  
Full implementation of our Fit for 55 proposals would lower our gas consumption by 
30%, equivalent to  100 bcm, by 2030. Together with additional gas diversification and 
more renewable gases,  frontloaded energy savings and  electrification have the potential  
to jointly deliver at least the equivalent of the 155 bcm imports of Russian gas .  
 
The energy efficiency first principle is more relevant than ever and should be applied across 
all sectors and policies, with demand response measures complementing those o n the supply -
side. 
Given the circumstances, the co -legislators might also want to consider to boost the Fit for 55 
proposals with higher or earlier targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency.

The Commission stands ready to propose a R EPower EU plan based on an identification, 
in dialogue with Member States, of  the most suitable projects and reforms,  at national, 
regional and EU levels. This will build on national  energy and climate plans and their updates , 
existing R ecovery and Resilience Plan s (RRPs) , cohesion policy  operational programme s and  
7 any other relevant plans  and climate resilience  needs . Projects  completing internal market in 
energy and those with a strong cross -border dimension should  be privileged , for instance 
the critical connection between Portugal, Spain and France  and , between Bulgaria and Greece . 
Such  projects will improve the interconnection of the European gas and electricity networks 
and other infrastructure and fully synchronise our power grids , such as between the Baltic 
States and the Continental European Network . A regional analysis should under pin Member 
States plans. The Commission w ould provide support as done for RRP and technical assistance 
via the Technical Support Instrument . Financing needs  will be assessed based on a 
comprehensive mapping of the needs of Member States as well a s of cross -border investment 
needs. To meet these, all resources and tools available at national and EU level should be 
mobilised, with p ublic fund ing designed to crowd -in private investment . 
2.1. Diversify gas supplies  
 
2.1.1. LNG and pipe imports  
An unprecedented LNG supply to the EU in January 2022 has ensured security of gas supply 
for this winter . The EU c ould import 50  bcm more of LNG  (e.g. from Qatar, USA , Egypt, West 
Africa ) on a yearly basis . Diversification of pipe sources (e.g. Azerbaijan, Algeria, Norway) 
could deliver  another  10 bcm of yearly savings on Russian gas imports . 
The Commission will assess as a matter of priority whether measures and investments are 
needed in hydrogen -ready gas infrastructure and interconnections to overcome bottlenecks to 
the full use of the EU ’s LNG capacity.   
While diversifying supply, the EU fosters its international partnerships.  The Commission will 
continue discuss ing within G7 and with  major global purchasers of gas (Japan, South Korea, 
China, India) medium -term market developments.  
2.1.2. Increase the EU production of bio methane  
Doubling the objective of Fit for 55 for biomethane would lead  to the production of 35 
billion cubic metres (bcm) per year  by 2030 . To do so, Member  States’ CAP strategic plans  
should channel funding to biomethane produced  from sustainable biomass sources, including 
in particular agricultural wastes and residues .  
2.1.3. Hydrogen Accelerator   
An additional 15 m illion tonnes (mt) of renewable hydrogen on top of the 5,6 mt foreseen 
under the Fit for 55 can replace 25-50 bcm per year of imported Russian gas  by 2030 . 
This would be made of additional 10 mt of imported hydrogen from diverse sources and an 
additional 5 mt of hydrogen produced in Europe, going beyond the targets of the EU’s 
hydrogen strategy  and maximising the domestic production of hydrogen15. Other forms of 
fossil -free hydrogen, notably nuclear -based, also play a role in substituting natural gas.  
The Commission will further develop the regulatory framework to promote a European market 
for hydrogen and support the development of an integrated gas and hydrogen 
infrastructure , hydrogen storage facilities  and port infrastructure. New cross border 
                                                           
15  COM(2020) 301 final: A hydrogen strateg y for a climate -neutral Europe .  
8 infrastructure should be hydrogen compatible. The Commission will assess State aid 
notification  for hydrogen projects as a matter of priority. It commits to complete the assessment 
of the first Important  Projects of Common European Interest  on hydrogen within 6 weeks from 
the submission by the participating Member States of a complete notification . The shared aim 
should be to enable the assessment to be completed by summer.  
Additionally, the Commission w ill support pilot projects on renewable hydrogen production 
and transport in the EU neighbourhood, starting with a Mediterranean Green Hydrogen 
Partnership. It will also work with partners to conclude Green Hydrogen Partnerships  and 
with the industry to es tablish  a Global European Hydrogen Facility , boosting Member 
States’ access to affordable renewable hydrogen.  
 
2.2. Reducing faster our dependence on fossil fuels  
2.2.1.  Rollin g out solar, wind and heat pumps  
Fit for 55 foresees the doubling  of the EU’s photovoltaic and wind capacities by 2025 and 
tripl ing by 2030 , saving 1 70bcm of yearly gas consumption by 2030.  
By accelerating the roll out of rooftop solar PV systems by up to 15TWh this year  the EU 
could save an additional 2,5 bcm of gas . The Commission will present in June a 
communication on solar energy with the aim of helping unlock solar energy’s potential as a 
major renewable energy source in the EU. Based on an analysis of the state of play of solar 
energy across the EU, the solar strateg y will  propose a European Solar Rooftops Initiative, 
which will  identify barriers, propose measures to accelerate the roll -out and ensure that the 
public can fully reap the benefits of rooftop solar energy.  
The Commission  will help further develop the value chain for solar and wind energy  and 
for heat pumps , also boost ing the EU’s competitiveness and tackle strategic dependencies. If 
necessary to crowd -in sufficient private investment , measures will include channelling EU 
financing to next -generation te chnologies, mobilising InvestEU or Member States’ support.  
Particular attention would be paid to the acceleration of investments in reskilling and upskilling 
of the workforce, which are essential to support the transformation.  
The Commission, Member States  and industry should continue  to close ly monitor the supply 
of critical and other raw materials , promote strategic partnerships for securing supplies and 
consider taking other action , such as strategic stockpiling,  if necessary.  
By doubling  its planned yearly pace of deployment of heat pumps in in the first half of this 
period , the EU  would  reach 10 million heat pumps installed in the next five years .  This would 
save 12 bcm for every 10 million heat pumps installed by households . The accelerated market 
deployment of heat pumps will require rapid upscaling of the entire supply chain and be 
accompanied by measures to boost building renovation and district heating system 
modernisation.  
Beyond home and building projects, energy supplies based on wind, solar and other low 
emission sources for power generation would also reduce our dependence on gas .   
9 2.2.2. Decarbonis ing industry  
The REPower EU plan  could  accelerate the deployment of innovative hydrogen -based 
solutions and cost-competitive renewable electricity in industrial sectors . The Commission 
would  bring forward  the implementation of the Innovation Fund in order to support the switch 
to electrification and hydrogen, including through an EU -wide scheme for carbon contracts for 
difference, and to  enhance the EU’s manufacturing  capabilities for innovative zero  and low 
carbon equipment, such as electrolysers , next gener ation solar/wind, and other  technologies .  
2.2.3. Enabling faster  permitting  
A precondition f or the acceleration of renewable energy projects to materialise  is to 
simplif y and shorten  permitting . Lengthy administrative procedures have been identified as 
one of the key obstacles for investments in renewables  and related infrastructure . These should 
be addressed by  full and rapid transposition of the Renewable Energy Directive16 currently in 
force, implementation of the corresponding reforms and measures in Member States’ recovery 
and resilience plans as well as the provisions relating to permitting of infrastructure in the 
revised TEN -E framework17. 
The Commission  calls on Member States to ensure that the planning, construction and 
operation of plants for the production of energy from renewable sources, their connection to 
the grid and the  related  grid itself are considered as being in the  overriding public interest  and 
in the interest of public sa fety and qualify for the most favourable procedure available in 
their planning and permitting procedures.  
Member States should swiftly map, assess and ensure suitable land and sea areas that are 
available for renewable energy projects,  commensurate with their national energy and 
climate plans, the contributions towards the revised 2030 renewable energy target and other 
factors such as the availability of resources, grid infrastructure and the targets of the EU 
Biodiversity Strategy . The Commission will propose  in the upcom ing nature restoration law  
proposal that Member States should, when preparing their national plans  to meet  restoration 
targets , take into account limited and clearly defined areas as particularly suitable  (‘go-to’ 
areas) , while avoiding as much as possible environmentally valuable areas.  Member States can 
use the review of their plans under  the Maritime Spatial Planning Directive  to further the 
deployment of  renewable  energy project s. 
In May , the Commission will publish a recommendation  on fast permitting for renewable 
energy projects  and will work to support the use of all flexibilities already granted by EU 
legislation and the  remov al of remaining obstacles,  whatever their origin.   
The Commission will also provide guidance on when and how regulatory sandboxes  are 
needed to enable the testing of innovative technologies, products or services that aim to 
advance the  coexistence of renewable deployment and environmental protection . The g uidance 
will focus on setting up the boundaries of regulatory sandboxes such as defining the timeframe, 
territory and continued regulatory supervision to minimise any risks.

(EC) No 714/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 .  
10 The Commission and the EIB Group will conclude in 2022 on the  financing mechanisms that 
would be best suited to promote the development of  power purchase agreements (PPAs)  in 
Europe , which  is already possible under InvestEU . This will  includ e facilitating better access 
to PPAs for new off -takers such as SMEs . 
 
CONCLUSION  
Developments in energy markets in recent  months , and especially the dramatic change in our 
security situation in recent weeks,  require to drastically  accelerate the clean energy transition 
and thereby increase Europe’s energy independence .    
Immediate  actions are warranted to mitigate the impact of high prices for households, farmers, 
businesses and industry.   
Breaking the dependency on Russian fossil fuels will accelerate the change of the energy mix 
in Member States, which should be reflected in the functioning of the electricity market.  
A European policy on gas storage will improve preparedness  for the next winter season  and 
beyond . Joint and coordinated action is the best contingency response to the challenges we 
face.  
The Commission is ready to develop  a REPowerEU  plan , in cooperation with Member 
States , by the summer , to support the diversification of energy supplies, accelerate the 
transition to renewable energy and  improve energy efficiency . This would accelerate the 
phasing out of Russian gas impo rts and reliance on fossil fuels and provide the best insurance 
against price shocks  in the medium term  by fast -forwarding the EU’s green transition , with a 
special focus on cross -border and regional needs . The need for greater security of supply is 
adding a new impetus to the objectives of the European Green Deal.

ADDRESSING THE EMERG ENCY Very high energy prices hurting economy . The European Central Bank estimate invasion energy price shocks reduce GDP growth around 0.5 percentage points 2022. Continued high energy price likely increase poverty affect business competitiveness. Energy -intensive industries particular faced higher manufacturing costs2. High energy prices also mean higher prices commodities, notably food . A combination higher energy , transport higher food prices would exacerbate pressure low income households , increased risks poverty . The Commission’s toolbox3 October 2021 helped mitigate impact high energy prices. The measures continued long necessary. To address current emergency, Commission look possible options emergency measures limit contagion effect gas prices electricity prices, temporary price limits. It consult matter urgency concer ned actors propose options coming weeks. The Commission also assess options optimise electricity market design reap benefits low cost energy. It take account final report European Union Agency th Cooperation Energy Regulators (ACER) contributions functioning electricity market benefits drawbacks alternative electricity pricing mechanisms . It follow appropriate keep electricity affordable without disrupting supply investment green transition . 1.1.Mitigating retail prices supporting heavily exposed companies The Commission confirms price regulation transfer mechanisms help protect consumers economy possible . The legal framework electricity market , particular (5) electricity Directive4, allows Member States , current exceptional circumstances , set retail price households micro -enterprises. The Commission provides detailed guidance Annex 1 Communication help Member States devise schemes regulated prices . This could accompanied incentives energy efficiency savings, reduce energy bills. EU State aid rules offer Member States options provide short -term relief companies farmers affected high energy prices, help reduce exposure energy price volatility medium long term. For example, Member States offer temporary relief companies facing liquidity needs due current high energy prices , regardless size, based guidelines rescue restructuring5. The Commission treat cases 2 Over half EU’s aluminium zinc smelters today operating reduced capacity temporarily closed. The EU temporarily lost 650 000 tonnes primary aluminium capacity, bout 30% total. 3 COM(2021) 660 final 13 October 2021: Tackling rising energy prices: toolbox action support . 4 Directive (EU) 2019/944 European Parliament Council 5 June 2019 common rules internal market electricity amending Directive 2012/27/EU (OJ L158, 14.6.2019, p. 125 –199). 5 Communication Commission - Guidelines State aid rescuing restruc turing non -financial undertakings difficulty (OJ C 249, 31.7.2014, p.1 ).

Undertakings difficulty also benefit face ‘acute liquidity needs due exceptional unforeseen circumstances’ 3 priority special attention gas utilities intermediaries faced increased supply costs due contracts disruptions. The EU Emissions Trading System State aid Guidelines6 enable Member States specifically support sectors that, risk carbon leakage indirect emission costs . In agricultural sector, State aid rules7 allow investment aid sustainable energy. In -going review th ose rules , Commission’s proposal8 public consultation increases options provide support farmers . The Commission ready use full flexibility State aid toolbox order enable Member States support companies sectors severely impacted current geopolitical developments. To enable Member States rem edy serious disturbance economy resulting Russia’s military aggression Ukraine , Commission shortly consulting Member States needs scope new, self -standing Temporary Crisis Framework9. Such Framework could example allow liquidity support undertakings directly indirectly affected crisis aid undertakings10, particular energy -intensive consumers , compensate part increase energy costs due price shock since Russian invasion . The Commission also consulted Member States targeted amendments ETS State aid guidelin es, particular expand list eligible sectors, ensuring subject reinforced incenti ves improve energy efficiency and/or decarbonise production limiting competition distortions among Member States . To finance emergency measures, Member States consider temporary tax measures windfall profits. According International Energy Agency fiscal measures high rents could make available EUR 200 billion 2022 partially offset higher energy bills11. Such measures retroactive, technologically neutral allow electricity producers cover costs protect long -term market carbon price signals. Annex 2 sets conditions instruments meet. Member States also use higher expected ETS revenues . From 1 January 2021 28 February 2022, revenues generated auctioning EU ETS allowances amounted around EUR 30 billion12.

Preparing next winter nsuring sufficient gas storage Gas supplies sufficient end winter even case full disruption supplies Russia . In order well -prepared next winter , filling gas storage across EU start now. During heating season, storage reduces need import additional volume. Storage contributes absorbing supply shocks. Gas storage supplies 25 -30% gas consumed winter. Gas storage levels proven particularly low sites owned third country entities ( i.e. Gazprom). In parallel, ransmission system operators also coordinate measures update optimise capacities available network case reduced flows pressure East . The Commission make legislative proposal April ensure annual adequate level storage13. This proposal require existing storage infrastructures EU territory filled least 90% capacity 1 October year . In order make storage attractive market participants, Commission propose increase rebate level 100% incentive refill storage. An EU gas storage policy ensure fairness allow making smart use existing infrastructure, limiting need new infrastructure Member States underground storage facilities territories . The legal proposal set mechanism ensure fair allocation security supply costs . Indeed, benefits guaranteed high filling level, terms insurance value security supply risks price dampening effects winter limited country storage located. Interconnectors essential ensu uninterrupted energy flow within whole EU. If new infrastructure needed, hydrogen compatible. In light current geopolitical environment , Commission envisages legal proposal identify gas storage critical infrastructure introduce provisions tackle ownership risks gas infrastructure . Member State require regulatory authority another competent authority designated Member State certify ownership person persons third country put risk security supply . Such assessment done existing future storage operators. In short term pending legislative process , Member States act legislation already place take measures ensure refilling storage time next winter. Moreover, foreseen existing Gas Security Supply Regulation14, need conclude solidarity arrangements. Given current contex done without delay . To incentivise refilling, Member States provide aid suppliers 107(3)(c) TFEU example form guarantees ( ‘two-way contract difference’ ). 13 13 Member States - BE, BG, DK, ES, FI, FR, HU, IT, LT, LV, PL, PT, SE storage obligations place. Others, e.g. DE announced plans introduce . 14 Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 European Parliament Council 25 October 2017 conce rning measures safeguard security gas supply repealing Regulation (EU) No 994/2010 (OJ L 280, 28.10.2017, p. 1 –56). 5 For part, Commission coordinate refilling operations , example joint procurement, collecting orders matching supplies. A joint European platform contractuali sation gas supply based bilateral negotiations major gas producers would help diversification smart risk management , hence ensuring security supplies favourable conditions buyers across EU . The Commission also pursuing investigation gas market response concerns regarding potential distortions competition companies active European gas markets , notably Russian gas supplier Gazprom. The company displays unusual business behaviour, verage filling level EU Gazprom -operated storage around 16% , wher eas non -Gazprom storage 44%. The Commission currently investigating matter priority allegations potential anti-competitive commercial conduct Gazprom gathering additional information market players. The Commission continues work neighbours partners Western Balkans, Energy Community , share EU’s fossil fuel dependencies exposure price hikes, also committed long term climate goals . For Ukraine , Moldova Georgia , EU stands ready support ensure reliable sustainable energy necessary. The ongoing effort provide emergency synchronisation Ukrainian Moldovan electricity grids continental Eur opean grid clear token commitment. II. REPOWER EU: ELIMINATING OUR DEPENDENCE ON RUSSIAN FOSSIL FUELS Phasing dependence fossil fuels Russia done well 2030 . To so, Commission proposes REPower EU plan increas resilience EU -wide energy system based two pillars :  Diversifying gas supplies , via higher LNG imports pipeline imports non - Russian suppliers, higher levels biomethane hydrogen.  Reducing faster dependence fossil fuels level homes , buildings industry, level power system boosting energy efficiency gains, increasing share renewable addressing infrastructure bottlenecks. Full implementation Fit 55 proposals would lower gas consumption 30%, equivalent 100 bcm, 2030. Together additional gas diversification renewable gases, frontloaded energy savings electrification potential jointly deliver least equivalent 155 bcm imports Russian gas . The energy efficiency first principle relevant ever applied across sectors policies, demand response measures complementing n supply - side. Given circumstances, co -legislators might also consider boost Fit 55 proposals higher earlier targets renewable energy energy efficiency. 6 REPOWER EU TRACK FOCUS FF55 AMBITION BY 2030 REPOWEREU MEASURE REPLACED BY THE END OF 2022 (BCM equivalent) estimate ADDITIONAL TO FF55 BY 2030 (BCM equivalent) estimate GAS DIVERSIFICATION NON -RU NATURAL GAS - LNG diversification 50* 50 - Pipeline import diversification 10 10 MORE RENEWABLE GAS 17 bcm biomethane production, saving 17 bcm Boost b iomethane production 35bcm 2030 3.5 18 5.6 million tonnes renewable hydrogen, saving 9- 18.5 bcm Boost h ydrogen production imports 20mt 2030 - 25-50 ELECTRIFY EUROPE HOMES Energy efficiency measures, saving 38 bcm EU-wide energy saving , e.g. turning thermostat buildings’ heating 1°C , saving 10bcm 14 10 Counted overall RES figures Solar rooftops front loading – 15 TWh within year 2.5 frontloaded 30 million newly installed heat pumps installed 2030 , saving 35 bcm 2030 Heat pump roll front loading doubling deployment resulting cumulative 10 million units next 5 year 1.5 frontloaded POWER SECTOR Deploy 480 GW wind capacities 420 GW solar capacities, saving 170bcm (and producing 5.6 Mt Green Hydrogen) Wind solar front loading, increasing average deployment rate 20%, saving 3bcm gas, additional capacities 80GW 2030 accommodate higher production renewable hydrogen. 20 Gas savings higher ambition counted green hydro gen, rest frontloaded TRANSFORM INDUSTRY ENERGY - INTENSIVE INDUSTRIES Front load electrification renewable hydrogen uptake Front load Innovation Fund extend scope carbon contracts difference Gas savings counted renewable hydrogen renewables targets *all figures estimates The Commission stands ready propose R EPower EU plan based identification, dialogue Member States, suitable projects reforms, national, regional EU levels.

Gemeenteblad  2025  nr. 24707 21 januari  2025 1 Bijlag e 4 BET Specifiek  beoor delingsk ader  kleine  windt urbines  (≤20m as) 
  
Algemeen 
Bijlage  4 dient  als een uitwerking  en specificering  van generiek e en specifiek e beoordelingsk ader s in 
hoofdstukk en 4, 5 en 6 van het Beleidsk ader  Energietransitie.  De opgenomen  beleidsregels  dienen  als 
richtinggevend  kader  bij aanvraagbeoordelingen.  In geval  van tegenstrijdigheid  tussen  de bepalingen 
van het algemene  BET en die van deze bijlage,  prevaleren  de bepalingen  van deze bijlage. 
  
Begr ippenlijst: 
• Kleine  windt urbines : naar  definitie  van het provinciaal  omgevingsbeleid:  windturbines  met een 
maximale  ashoogte  van 20 meter . Deze opgewekte  elektriciteit  wordt  lokaal verbruikt,  en eventueel 
overschot wordt  terug  geleverd  aan het openbare  elektriciteitsnetwerk. 
• Best emmingsvlak : een geometrisc h bepaald  vlak met eenz elfde  bestemming. 
• Bouwvlak : een geometrisc h bepaald  vlak waarmee  gronden  zijn aangeduid  waar ingev olge de 
regels  bepaalde  gebouwen  en bouwwerk en geen  gebouw  zijnde  zijn toegelaten. 
Ad 1. Kleine  windt urbines 
Ter invulling  van het onderdeel  kleine  windturbines  in het Beleidsk ader Energietransitie  [BET],  vastgesteld 
op 9 februari  2023,  is hieronder  dit beleidsonderdeel  weergegeven. 
Dit onderdeel  is tot stand  gekomen  in samenspraak  met het Gebiedsplatform  Alblasserw aard-V ijfhee- 
renlanden  en de gemeente  Vijfheerenlanden. 
  
Doel  van dit onderdeel  van het beleidsk ader  is het bieden  van inzicht aan initiatiefnemer s en omwonen- 
den onder  welk e voorw aarden  binnen  de gemeente  Vijfheerenlanden  kleine  windturbines  aanvaardbaar 
en wenselijk  worden  geac ht. 
Dit betek ent duidelijkheid  over: 
▪ Waar plaatsing  van kleine  windturbines  is toegestaan. 
▪ Welke eisen  gesteld  worden  aan de windturbine(s)  en de locatie(s). 
De nieuwe  normering  heeft effect op het toetsingsk ader  voor vergunningverlener s en specialisten. 
Toetsingsk ader s voor geluid  en trillingen  worden  met ingang van 1-1-2024  (inwerkingtreding  Omge- 
vingswet)  opgenomen  in het Omgevingsplan  en vormt  daarin  een integraal  onderdeel  voor toetsing 
van initiatieven.  Vergunning aanvragen  zijn straks  alleen  nog nodig  bij vergunningplic htige  milieubelas- 
tende  activiteiten.  Windturbines  met een rotordiameter  van 2 m of meer  (Artikel 3.11 van het Bal (Besluit 
activiteiten  leefomgeving)),  een windpark  met 3 of meer  windturbines  (artikel 3.13 van het Bal) zijn 
milieubelastende  activiteiten.  Hiernaast  moeten  windturbines  voldoen  aan voorw aardes  gesteld  in het 
omgevingsplan.  Buitenplanse  omgevingsplanacti viteiten  zijn altijd  vergunningplic htig.  Bovengrondse 
bouwwerk en geen  gebouw  zijnde  van boven de 20 meter  hebben  een meldingsplic ht (artikel 4.427  van 
het Bal). 
  
Algemene  voorw aarden 
▪ Kleinsc halige  windturbines  in woongebieden  binnen  de bebouwde  kom zijn niet toegestaan. 
▪ Er dient  onderz oek te worden  aangeleverd  waaruit  de haalbaarheid  van zon-op-dak  verkend is. 
Indien  het niet mogelijk  is om in de eigen  energiebehoef te te voorzien  met zonnepanelen  of als 
deze niet toereik end zijn, kan overwogen  worden  om in beginsel  een windturbine  te plaatsen1. 
▪ De initiatiefnemer  heeft met direct  belanghebbenden  binnen  een straal  van 250 meter  overleg 
gevoerd  over de plannen.  Bij de aanvraag  dient  een verslag van deze participatie  gevoegd  te 
worden.  De resultaten  van dit verslag worden  integraal  aan de gemeente  ter besc hikking  gesteld. 
De impact  voor omwonenden  vertalen  naar  financiële  compensatie  voor omwonenden  is niet 
verplic ht. 
▪ Het plaatsen  van kleine  windturbines  blijft altijd  maatwerk.  De gemeente  Vijfheerenlanden  kan 
daarom  in voorkomende  situaties  nadere  eisen  stellen  aan of besluiten  de aanvraag  te weigeren 
op basis  van het beeldkw aliteitsplan. 
Geluid  en slagsc haduw 
De geplaatste  windturbines  dienen  de marges  van § 4.30 van het Bal niet te overschrijden  om overlast 
van omwonenden  op basis  van geluid  en slagsc haduw  te voorkomen: 
• De mate  van geluid  mag  geen  45 Lden en 40 Lnight (dag-  en nachtgeluid  in decibels  tussen  07:00- 
19:00 en 23:00-07:0 0 respectievelijk)  overschrijden 
1) Bij het bepalen  of zonnepanelen  alleen,  toereik end zijn voor de energievraag,  wordt  zoveel mogelijk  gekeken naar  de energievraag 
op specifiek e momenten.  Mocht bijvoorbeeld  een agrariër  een hoog  energieverbruik  hebben  voor zonsopg ang, om zijn koeien  te 
melk en, kan een vergunning  voor een windturbine  worden  toegek end. Ondanks  dat zonnepanelen  mogelijk  over een jaar gezien

Voor het plaatsen  van een windturbine  bij agrarisc he bedrijven  buiten  bestaand  stads-  en dorpsgebied 
gelden  ten opzic hte van het hierv oor genoemde  de volgende  aanvullende  voorw aarden: 
▪ Plaatsing  van kleine  windturbines  wordt  uitsluitend  toegestaan  bij agrarisc he bedrijven,  bedrijven 
en de daarbij  gelegen  bedrijfswoningen.  Overige  aanvragen  zijn enkel na raadsbesluit  toe te staan. 
▪ Het uitgangspunt  is het plaatsen  van de windturbine  binnen  het bouwvlak.  Indien  aantoonbaar 
dat dit niet tot de mogelijkheid  behoor t (ook bij het ontbrek en van een bouwvlak)  en er geen 
zwaarwegende  bezw aren  zijn, kan overwogen  worden  de windturbine  buiten  het bouwvlak  en 
aansluitend  op bestaande  bebouwing  of erfindeling  te plaatsen,  mits direct  grenz end aan het

Bijlag e 5 BET Specifiek e beoor delingsk ader  zon op grond (water) 
  
Algemeen 
Bijlage  5 dient  als een uitwerking  en specificering  van generiek e en specifiek e beoordelingsk ader s in 
hoofdstukk en 4, 5 en 7 van het Beleidsk ader  Energietransitie.  In geval  van tegenstrijdigheid  tussen  de 
bepalingen  van het algemene  BET en die van deze bijlage,  prevaleren  de bepalingen  van deze bijlage. 
  
Bij de aanvraag  voor een vergunning  van zon op grond,  zal de gemeente  Vijfheerenlanden  de maximale 
mogelijkheid  benut ten om, via de geplande  aanpassing  door  het Rijk van het Besluit  bouwwerk en 
leefomgeving  [Bbl],  eigenaren  van bestaande  utiliteitsgebouwen  met een gebruiksoppervlakte  > 250 
m2 te verplic hten  om de (volledige)  dakpotentie  te benut ten voor de opwek  van zonne-energie  t.b.v. 
het eigen  gebruik,  alsmede  voor alle bouwwerk en. Dit alvorens  een vergunning  te verlenen  voor zon 
op grond. 
  
Beleid  gemeent e  Vijfheer enlanden 
De energietransitie  is een belangrijk  thema  binnen  het gemeentelijk  beleid.  Op verschillende  manieren 
wordt  de opwekking  van hernieuwbare  energie,  zowel  klein-  als grootsc halig,  gestimuleerd.  Zoals  in 
sectie  7 “Kader s bij zonnestroomsystemen ” van het BET is benoemd,  is er een voork eurspositie  gegeven 
aan zon op dak. Daarnaast  is het mogelijk  om op het erf, binnen  het bestemmingsvlak  van de woning 
of het bedrijf  zonnestroomsystemen  op de grond  te plaatsen;  hierv oor is een omgevingsvergunning 
voor de omgevingsplanacti viteit  nodig. 
  
Zonneladder , voorkeursv olgorde plaatsing  zonnestr oomsyst emen  op grond. 
Om de landsc happelijk e impact  te beperk en en ‘wildgroei’  van grondgebonden  zonnestroomsystemen 
te voorkomen,  wordt  een voork eursvolgorde  gehanteerd  die leidt tot de volgende  stappen: 
1. Zonnestroomsystemen  grondgebonden  voor eigen  gebruik  binnen  het bouwvlak. 
2. Zonnestroomsystemen  grondgebonden  voor eigen  gebruik  binnen  het bestemmingsvlak. 
3. Zonnestroomsystemen  grondgebonden  voor eigen  gebruik  buiten  het bestemmingsvlak. 
4. Zonnestroomsystemen  grondgebonden  voor gebruik  door  derden  buiten  het bestemmingsvlak. 
Wanneer  zonnepanelen  op daken en grondgebonden  plaatsing  van zonnepanelen  binnen  het bestem- 
mingsvlak  redelijk erwijs  niet mogelijk  zijn, kunnen  grondgebonden  initiatieven  buiten  het bestemmings- 
vlak overwogen  worden.  Bijvoorbeeld  bij onvoldoende  besc hikbare  ruimte,  schaduwv orming,  bestaand 
gebruik  van de tuin,  etc. Beoordeling  hiervan  is altijd  maatwerk  en verwez en wordt  naar  de algemene 
regels  van pagina’ s 18 en 19 van het BET. 
  
Mog elijkheden  zon op grond in  Vijfheer enlanden 
  
Algemene  uitgangspunt en 
Vijfheerenlanden  kent een open  en aantrekk elijk landsc hap. De keuze om alleen  kleinsc halige  zonnepark en 
toe te staan  draagt  bij aan het behoud  van de kwaliteit  van het landsc hap. 
  
Randv oorw aarden  voor zon op grond 
▪ Alleen  voor eigen  gebruik  (op een woonk avel). 
▪ Als onderdeel/uitbreiding  van een (agrarisc h) bedrijfsperceel. 
▪ Aansluitend  aan en als onderdeel  van een kern t.b.v. lokale (collectieve)  opwek. 
▪ Vijfheerenlanden  streef t naar  op de lokale maat  afgestemde  zonnepark en. 
▪ De maat  en schaal van een zonnepark  moet  worden  afgestemd  op de omgeving  waarbij  een 
landsc happelijk e inpassing  moet  worden  gerealiseerd  die passend  is bij het omliggende  landsc hap, 
buur t en kern. 
▪ Uitgangspunt  hierbij  is overigens  ook dat nooit  een boom  in de openbare  ruimte  gesnoeid  en/of 
gekapt zal worden  met als doel het vergroten  van de opbrengst  van de zonnepanelen. 
▪ De algemene  wet- en regelgeving  is onverkor t van toepassing.  Zie ook onder  windturbines. 
▪ Het plaatsen  van zonnepanelen  op grond  blijft altijd  maatwerk.  De gemeente  Vijfheerenlanden 
kan daarom  in voorkomende  situaties  nadere  eisen  stellen  aan of besluiten  de aanvraag  te weigeren 
op basis  van het beeldkw aliteitsplan. 
▪ Plaatsing  van zon op grond  systemen  wordt  niet toegestaan  in potentiële  woningbouwlocaties 
in de kernrandz ones  rond  de dorpen  en steden  in de gemeente  Vijfheerenlanden. 
Zonnepark en als onderdeel  van bijvoorbeeld  een woonk avel of een agrarisc h bedrijfsperceel  worden 
als zodanig  niet benoemd  door  de provincie,  maar  wil Vijfheerenlanden  wel toestaan.  De gemeente 
ziet dit als een functioneel  onderdeel  in de energietransitie  en als uitbreiding  van bijvoorbeeld  het 
agrarisc he erf. De erfuitbreiding  moet  daarom  als een integraal  onderdeel  van het gebouw  en/of  omge- 
ving/erf  worden  geplaatst  en landsc happelijk  worden  ingepast. 
  
Plaatsing  en locatie  onder  algemene  uitgangspunt en 
Gemeenteblad  2025  nr. 24707 21 januari  2025 5 
Een omgevingsvergunning  ten behoeve  van de plaatsing  en het gebruik  van een grondgebonden  zon- 
nestroomsysteem  inclusief  bijbehorende  montagematerialen  en bekabeling,  kan worden  verleend  met 
dien verstande  dat het zonnestroomsysteem  wordt  geplaatst  ten behoeve  van het voorzien  in de 
energiebehoef te van de eigen  woning,  bedrijf  en/of  gebouw  van een maatsc happelijk e instelling/org a- 
nisatie. 
  
Er mag  enkel een grondgebonden  zonnestroomsysteem  binnen  of indien  redelijk erwijs  noodzak elijk 
buiten  het bestemmingsvlak  worden  geplaatst,  indien  volgens  de voork eursvolgorde  plaatsing  op het 
dak redelijk erwijs  niet mogelijk  is (ook gelet  op het doel bijvoorbeeld  bij een gezamenlijk e opwek  voor 
een huizenblok,  etc.).  Voor wat betref t de situering  van het zonnestroomsysteem  geldt  dat: 
▪ Het zonnestroomsysteem  achter de voorgevelrooilijn  van het hoofdgebouw  wordt  geplaatst. 
▪ Daarbij  dient  te bij voorkeur worden  voldaan  aan de bebouwingsregels  van het ter plaatse  geldende 
bestemmingsplan  (bijvoorbeeld  maximale  hoogtes  van bouwwerk en). 
Behoud  landbouwgr ond 
Het uitgangspunt  blijft dat er geen  zonnepark en worden  gerealiseerd  op landbouwgrond.  Dit betek ent 
dat alleen  voor kleinsc halige  zonnepark en vooreigen  gebruik  (maximaal  100m2)  een uitzondering  wordt 
gemaakt.  Grootsc halige  zonnepark en op landbouwgrondzijn  expliciet  uitgesloten.  Een uitzondering  is 
mogelijk  in gevallen  van meerv oudig  grondgebruik,  bijvoorbeeld  bij zonnepanelen  boven een fruitboom- 
gaard.  In deze situaties  kan maatwerk  worden  toegepast. 
  
Behoud  de zeer open  landsc happen 
De zeer open  landsc happen  behoren  tot de kernkw aliteit  voor de gemeente  en worden  uitgesloten  voor 
het opwekk en van zonne-energie.  De impact  van zonne-energie  op het landsc hap is afhank elijk van de 
huidige  kwaliteit  van het landsc hap en de mate  van de aanwezige  dynamiek.  Voor open,  nog gave 
landsc happen  is de kwaliteit  hoog  en dit betek ent dat een visuele  toevoeging  van een zonnepark  een 
grotere  aantasting  is dan voor landsc happen  die al intensief  worden  gebruikt  door  bijvoorbeeld  recre- 
atie, bedrijvigheid  en bebouwing. 
  
Behoud  gebieden  en percelen  met bijzonder e status 
De gebieden  met een apar te besc hermingsstatus  in de gemeente  zijn: het Natuurnetwerk  Nederland 
(NNN),  Natura  2000 gebieden,  weidev ogelgebieden,  besc hermde  dorp  en stadsgezic hten  en het 
Unesco  wereld  erfgoed:  Nieuwe  Hollandse  waterlinie.  Uitgangspunt  is dat deze gebieden  zijn uitgesloten 
voor zon op grond.  Indien  zon op grond  op of nabij  een Rijks-  en gemeentelijk  monumenten  wordt 
geplaatst  is altijd  sprak e van maatwerk  waarbij  vooro verleg  met de Rijksdienst  voor Cultureel  Erfgoed 
en de Commissie  Ruimtelijk e Kwaliteit  nodig  is. 
  
Zon langs  infrastructurele werken 
Bij het plaatsen  van zonnepanelen  langs  (grote)  infrastructurele  werk en zoals een snelweg,  hanteren 
wij het uitgangspunt  dat dit niet ten koste  gaat van agrarisc he functies.  Gezien  de grote  potentie  van 
energieopwekking  en de relatief  lage impact  op landsc happelijk e waardes,  hanteren  wij maatwerk  voor 
het plaatsen  van panelen  langs  (grote)  infrastructurele  werk en. 
  
Lokaal initiatief 
Een voorw aarde  voor de gemeente  Vijfheerenlanden  is dat zonnepark en voortkomen  uit een lokaal 
initiatief . Bijvoorbeeld  in de vorm van een lokale coöperatie,  (agrarisc h) bedrijf , de gemeente,  een 
overheidsinstantie  of een samen werking  met één of meerdere  lokale partijen,  stichtingen  of verenigingen. 
Daarnaast  bieden  zonnepark en de mogelijkheid  om de omgeving  financieel  te laten  deelnemen  in 
duurzame  opwek  van energie  waardoor  er meer  lokaal eigenaar schap ontstaat.  Hierbij  wordt  50% lokaal 
eigenaar schap gehanteerd.  Een agrarisc h ondernemer  die een zonnepark  als uitbreiding  van zijn erf 
wil, wordt  gezien  als een lokale eigenaar . 
  
Voor elk initiatief  geldt  dat de omgeving  betrokk en wordt  bij de planvorming  en dat daarbij  de moge- 
lijkheden  van financiële  deelname  door  de omgeving  worden  onderz ocht. Het ontbrek en van draagvlak 
houdt  echter niet automatisc h in dat een aanvraag  voor een zonnepark  geweigerd  wordt.  Het streven 
is dat er op een passende  wijze inspanningen  zijn verricht om een breed  gedragen  plan te ontwikk elen. 
  
Als zon-op-dak  investeringen  meer  energie  opleveren  dan voor eigen  gebruik  afgenomen  kan worden, 
wordt  er energie  terug  geleverd  op het net. In dit geval  kan energie  uit panelen  op daken ook opengesteld 
worden  aan omwonenden. 
  
Zonne-energie  voor lokale behoef te is er dan ook op geric ht om deze zoveel mogelijk  samen  met bewo- 
ners en bedrijven  te ontwikk elen.  Door  deze verandering  van de leefomgeving  met de gemeensc hap 
af te stemmen,  ontstaan  kansen: 
▪ Lokaal een betere  afstemming  tussen  energievraag  en -aanbod. 
Gemeenteblad  2025  nr. 24707 21 januari  2025 6 
▪ De maat  en schaal van de energieopwekking  wordt  afgestemd  op de leefomgeving. 
▪ Veel ruimte  voor participatie. 
▪ Het vergroten  van het maatsc happelijk  draagvlak  en het maatsc happelijk  besef  over de noodzaak 
van het opwekk en van duurzame  energie. 
▪ Stimuleren  draagvlak,  participatie  en eigenaar schap 
▪ Draagvlak:  betrokk enheid  van de omgeving  bij het initiatief 
De gemeente  beoordeelt  of er draagvlak  is voor een zonnepark.  Niet iedereen  hoef t het met het project 
eens  te zijn, maar  de gemeente  wil wel dat de omgeving  betrokk en wordt  bij het initiatief . De initiatief- 
nemer  is hierv oor verantwoordelijk.  Bij de aanvraag  van een zonnepark  moet  aangetoond  worden  wat 
gedaan  is om draagvlak  onder  omwonenden  te realiseren.  Ook moet  de aanvrager  bij een grondgebon- 
den zonnestroomsysteem  aantoonbaar  omwonenden  hebben  betrokk en over ontwerp-  en locatiek euze. 
Een verslag daarvan  dient  integraal  onderdeel  uit te maken van een aanvraag. 
  
Zon op Waterproject en 
Voor zon op waterprojecten  wordt  de handreiking  voor waterschappen  gehanteerd  (december  2021). 
Praktisc he-handreiking-ZonOpW ater.pdf (unievan waterschappen.nl   ) 
  
Ad 3. Zon op dak bij monument en. 
Zoals  tijdens  het VHL-plein  bleek  uit de ervaringen  van de gemeente  Amer sfoor t, is de route  van een 
zonnepanelenk aart omslac htig,  duur , tijdro vend  en niet goed  passend  voor de schaal van Vijfheeren- 
landen. 
  
Gesteld  wordt  dan ook dat het huidige  beleid,  opgenomen  in het BET, reeds  voldoende  ‘flexibiliteit’ 
biedt  aan inwoner s. Tevens  wordt  meegedac ht vanuit  vergunningverlening  en is maatwerk  mogelijk. 
  
Voor zon op dak bij monumenten  worden  ‘Zonne-energie  op uw monument.  Wegwijz er voor eigenaren 
en huurder s’ en ‘Zonne-energieplannen  en monumenten.  Wegwijz er voor plantoetser s en vergunning- 
verlener s’ van de Rijksdienst  voor Cultuur  en Wetensc hap gehanteerd.

THE EUR OPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUR OPEAN UNION, 
Having regar d to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 194(2) thereof, 
Having regar d to the proposal from the European Commission, 
After transmission of the draf t legislative act to the national parliaments, 
Having regar d to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committ ee (1), 
Having regar d to the opinion of the Committ ee of the Regions (2), 
Acting in accordance with the ordinar y legislative procedure (3), 
Whereas: 
(1)  A number of amendments are to be made to Directive 2009/72/EC of the European Parliament and of the 
Council (4). In the inter ests of clarity, that Directive should be recast. 
(2)  The internal mark et for electr icity , which has been progressively implemented throughout the Union since 1999, 
aims, by organising competitive electr icity markets across countr y borders, to deliver real choice for all Union 
final customer s, be they citizens or businesses, new business oppor tunities, competiti ve prices, effic ient 
investment signals and higher standards of service, and to contr ibut e to secur ity of supply and sustainability . 
(3)  Directive 2003/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) and Directive 2009/72/EC have made 
a signif icant contr ibution towards the creation of the internal market for electr icity . However , the Union's energy 
system is in the middle of a prof ound change . The common goal of decarbonising the energy system creat es new 
oppor tunities and challenges for market participants. At the same time, technological developments allow for 
new forms of consumer participation and cross-border cooperation. There is a need to adap t the Union mark et 
rules to a new mark et reality . 
(4)  The Commission Communication of 25 Febr uary 2015, entitled ‘A Framew ork Strateg y for a Resilient Energy 
Union with a Forward-Looking Climate Change Policy’, sets out a vision of an Energy Union with citizens at its 
core, where citizens take ownership of the energy transition, benefit from new technologies to reduce their bills 
and participate actively in the mark et, and where vulnerable consumers are prote cted. 14.6.2019 L 158/125 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

in electr icity and repealing Directive 2003/54/EC (OJ L 211, 14.8.2009, p. 55). 
(5)Directive 2003/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 concer ning common rules for the inter nal market 
in electr icity and repealing Directive 96/92/EC (OJ L 176, 15.7.2003, p. 37), repealed and replaced, with effec t from 2 March 2011, by 
Directive 2009/72/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 concer ning common rules for the internal market 
in electr icity and repealing Directive 2003/54/EC (OJ L 211, 14.8.2009, p. 55). (5)  The Commission Communication of 15 July 2015, entitled ‘Deliver ing a New Deal for Energy Consumers’, put 
forward the Commission's vision for a retail mark et that better serves energy consumers, including by better 
linking wholesale and retail mark ets. By taking advantag e of new technology , new and inno vative energy service 
compan ies should enable all consumers to fully participate in the energy transition, managing their consump tion 
to deliver energy effic ient solutions which save them money and contr ibut e to the overall reduction of energy 
consum ption. 
(6)  The Commission Communication of 15 July 2015, entitled ‘Launching the public consultation process on a new 
energy mark et design’, highlight ed that the mov e awa y from generation in large central generating installations 
towards decentralised production of electr icity from renewable sources and towards decarbonised mark ets 
requires adapting the current rules of electr icity trading and changing the existing mark et roles. The Communi ­
cation underlined the need to organise electr icity mark ets in a more flexible manner and to fully integrat e all 
mark et players – including producers of renewable energy , new energy service provid ers, energy storag e and 
flexible demand. It is equally important for the Union to invest urgently in interconnection at Union level for the 
transfer of energy through high-vo ltage electr icity transmission systems. 
(7)  With a view to creating an internal market for electr icity , Member State s should foster the integration of their 
national markets and cooperation among system operat ors at Union and regional level, and incor porate isolate d 
system s that form electr icity islands that persist in the Union. 
(8)  In addition to addressing new challenges, this Directive seeks to address the persisting obstacles to the 
compl etion of the intern al mark et for electr icity . The refined regulator y framew ork needs to contr ibut e to 
overcoming the current problems of fragment ed national mark ets which are still often determined by a high 
degree of regulatory inter ventions. Such interventions have led to obstacles to the supply of electr icity on equal 
term s as well as higher costs in compar ison to solutions based on cross-border cooperation and mark et-based 
principles. 
(9)  The Union would most effectively meet its renewable energy targets through the creation of a mark et framewor k 
that rewards flexibility and innovati on. A well-functioning electr icity mark et design is the key factor enabling the 
uptak e of renewable energy . 
(10)  Consumers have an essential role to play in achieving the flexibility necessar y to adapt the electr icity system to 
variable and distr ibuted renewable electr icity generation. Technological progress in grid management and the 
generation of renewable electr icity has unlock ed many oppor tunities for consumers. Healthy competiti on in retail 
mark ets is essential to ensur ing the mark et-dr iven deplo yment of innovati ve new services that address consumers' 
changing needs and abilities, while increasing system flexibility . However , the lack of real-time or near real-time 
information provided to consumers about their energy consum ption has prevente d them from being active 
participants in the energy mark et and the energy transition. By empo wering consumers and providing them with 
the tools to participat e more in the energy market, including participating in new ways, it is intended that 
citizens in the Union benefi t from the internal market for electr icity and that the Union's renewable energy 
target s are attained. 
(11)  The freedoms which the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) guarant ees the citizens of the 
Union — inter alia, the free mov ement of goods, the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provid e 
services — are achievab le only in a fully open market, which enables all consumers freely to choose their 
suppliers and all suppliers freely to deliver to their custome rs. 
(12)  Promoting fair competition and easy access for different suppliers is of the utmost impor tance for Member States 
in order to allow consumers to take full advantag e of the oppor tunities of a liberalised internal mark et for 
electr icity . Nonetheless, it is possible that mark et failure persists in peripheral small electr icity system s and in 
system s not connecte d with other Member State s, where electr icity prices fail to provide the right signal to drive 
investment, and theref ore requires specific solutions to ensure an adequate level of secur ity of supply . 
(13)  In order to foster competition and ensure the supply of electr icity at the most competitive price, Member States 
and regulatory author ities should facilitate cross-border access for new suppliers of electr icity from diffe rent 
energy sources as well as for new providers of generation, energy storag e and demand response. 14.6.2019 L 158/126 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     (14)  Member States should ensure that no undue barriers exist within the internal market for electr icity as regar ds 
mark et entr y, operation and exit. At the same time, it should be clarified that that obligation is without prejudice 
to the compet ence that Member States retain in relation to third countr ies. That clarification should not be 
interpreted as enabling a Member State to exercise the excl usive compet ence of the Union. It should also be 
clarified that mark et participants from third countr ies who operate within the internal mark et are to comply with 
the applicable Union and national law in the same manner as other mark et participants. 
(15)  Mark et rules allow for the entr y and exit of producers and suppliers based on their assessment of the economic 
and financial viability of their operations. That principle is not incompatible with the possibility for Member 
States to impos e on under takings operating in the electr icity sector public service obligations in the general 
economic interest in accordance with the Treaties, in particular with Article 106 TFEU, and with this Directive 
and Regulation (EU) 2019/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6). 
(16)  The European Council of 23 and 24 October 2014 stated in its conclusions that the Commission, suppor ted by 
the Member States, is to take urgent measures in order to ensure the achievement of a minimum target of 10 % 
of existing electr icity inter connections, as a matt er of urgency , and no later than 2020, at least for Member States 
whic h have not yet attained a minimum level of integrat ion in the internal energy mark et, whic h are the Baltic 
States, Portugal and Spain, and for Member States which constitut e their main point of access to the intern al 
energy market. It further stated that the Commission is also to repor t regularly to the European Council with the 
objective of arriving at a 15 % target by 2030. 
(17)  Sufficient physical inter connection with neighbour ing countr ies is important to enable Member States and 
neighbour ing countr ies to benefit from the positive effects of the intern al mark et as stressed in the Commission 
Communication of 23 November 2017, entitled ‘Communication on strengthening Europe's energy netw orks’, 
and as reflected in Member State s' integrated national energy and climate plans under Regulation 
(EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7). 
(18)  Electr icity markets differ from other mark ets such as those for natural gas, for example because they involve the 
trading in a commodity whic h cannot currently be easily stored and whic h is produced using a large variety of 
generating installations, including through distr ibut ed generation. This has been reflecte d in the different 
approac hes to the regulatory treatment of interconnect ors in the electr icity and gas sectors. The integrat ion of 
electr icity mark ets requires a high degree of cooperation among system operat ors, market participants and 
regulatory author ities, in particular where electr icity is traded via mark et coupling. 
(19)  Secur ing common rules for a true internal mark et and a broad supply of electr icity that is accessible to all should 
also be one of the main goals of this Directive. To that end, undist orted mark et prices would provid e incentives 
for cross-border interconnections and for investments in new electr icity generation while leading to price 
conver gence in the long term. 
(20)  Mark et prices should give the right incentives for the development of the netw ork and for investing in new 
electr icity generation. 
(21)  Different types of market organisation exist in the internal mark et for electr icity . The measures that Member 
States could take in order to ensure a level playing field should be based on overriding requirements of general 
inter est. The Commission should be consulted on the compatib ility of those measures with the TFEU and with 
other Union law. 
(22)  Member States should maintain wide discretion to impose public service oblig ations on electr icity under takings 
in pursuing objectives of general economic inter est. Member States should ensure that household custome rs and, 
where Member State s consider it to be appropr iate, small enterprises, enjo y the right to be supplied with 
electr icity of a specifi ed quality at clearly compar able, transparent and competiti ve prices. Never theless, public 14.6.2019 L 158/127 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     
(6)Regulation (EU) 2019/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on the internal market for electr icity (see page 
54 of this Offi cial Jour nal). 
(7)Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the Governa nce of the Energy 
Union and Climate Action, amending Regulations (EC) No 663/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 of the European Parliament and of the 
Council, Directives 94/22/EC, 98/70/EC, 2009/31/EC, 2009/73/EC, 2010/31/EU, 2012/27/EU and 2013/30/EU of the European 
Parliament and of the Council, Council Directives 2009/119/EC and (EU) 2015/652 and repealing Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the 
European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 328, 21.12.2018, p. 1). service oblig ations in the form of price setting for the supply of electr icity constitute a fundamentally distor tive 
measure that often leads to the accumulation of tariff deficits, the limitation of consumer choice, poorer 
incentives for energy saving and energy efficiency investments, lower standards of service, lower levels of 
consumer engag ement and satisf action, and the restr iction of competiti on, as well as to there being fewer 
inno vative products and services on the mark et. Consequently , Member State s should apply other policy tools, in 
particular target ed social policy measures, to safeguard the affordability of electr icity supply to their citizens. Public 
inter ventions in price setting for the supply of electr icity should be carried out only as public service oblig ations 
and should be subject to specifi c conditions set out in this Directive. A fully liberalised, well-functioning retail 
electr icity mark et would stimulate price and non-pr ice competition among existing suppliers and provide 
incentives to new mark et entrants, thereby improving consumer choice and satisfa ction. 
(23)  Public service oblig ations in the form of price setting for the supply of electr icity should be used without 
overriding the principle of open mark ets in clearly defined circumstances and beneficiar ies and should be limite d 
in duration. Such circumstances might occur for exam ple where supply is severely constrained, causing signifi ­
cantly higher electr icity prices than normal, or in the event of a mark et failure where interventions by regulator y 
author ities and compe tition author ities have proven to be ineff ective. This would dispropor tionately affect 
households and, in particular , vulnerable custome rs who typically expend a higher share of their disposable 
income on energy bills compare d to high-income consumers. In order to mitig ate the distor tive effects of public 
service obligations in price setting for the supply of electr icity , Member States applying such inter ventions should 
put in place additional measures, including measures to prevent distor tions of price setting in the wholesale 
mark et. Member States should ensure that all benefic iaries of regulat ed prices are able to benefi t fully from the 
offers available on the competitive market when they choose to do so. To that end, those beneficiar ies need to be 
equipped with smar t metering systems and have access to dynamic electr icity price contracts. In addition, they 
should be directly and regularly informed of the offers and savings available on the competitive market, in 
particular relating to dynamic electr icity price contracts, and should be provid ed with assistance to respond to 
and benefit from mark et-based offers. 
(24)  The entitlement of benefi ciaries of regulated prices to receive individual smar t meters without extra costs should 
not prevent Member States from modifying the functionality of smar t metering systems where smar t mete r 
infrastr ucture does not exist because the cost-benefit assessment regarding the deplo yment of smar t metering 
system s was negative. 
(25)  Public inter ventions in price setting for the supply of electr icity should not lead to direct cross-subsidisation 
between diffe rent cate gories of custome r. According to that principle, price system s must not explicitly make 
certain categor ies of customer bear the cost of price interventions that affect other catego ries of customer . For 
examp le, a price system , in whic h the cost is borne by suppliers or other operat ors in a non-discr iminato ry 
manner , should not be considered to be direct cross-subsidisation. 
(26)  In order to ensure the maintenance of the high standards of public service in the Union, all measures take n by 
Member States to achi eve the objective of this Directive should be regularly notified to the Commission. The 
Commission should regularly publish a repor t analysing measures taken at national level to achi eve public service 
objectives and compari ng their effectiveness, with a view to making recommendations as regards measures to be 
take n at national level to achi eve high standards of public service. 
(27)  It should be possible for Member States to appoint a supplier of last resor t. That supplier might be the sales 
division of a vertically integrat ed under taking which also performs distr ibution functions, provided that it meets 
the unbundling requirements of this Directive. 
(28)  It should be possible for measures imple mented by Member States for the purpose of achieving the objectives of 
social and economic cohesion to include, in particular , the provis ion of adequat e economic incentives, using, 
where appropr iate, any existing national and Union tools. Such tools may include liability mechani sms to 
guarant ee the necessar y investment. 
(29)  To the extent that measures taken by Member State s to fulfil public service oblig ations constitute State aid under 
Article 107(1) TFEU, there is an oblig ation under Article 108(3) TFEU to notify them to the Commission. 14.6.2019 L 158/128 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     (30)  Cross–sectorial law provides a strong basis for consumer protect ion for a wide range of energy services that exist, 
and is likely to evolve. Never theless, certain basic contractual rights of customer s should be clearly established. 
(31)  Plain and unambiguous information should be made available to consumers concer ning their rights in relation to 
the energy sector . The Commission has established, after consulting relevant stakeholders, including Member 
States, regulatory author ities, consumer orga nisations and electr icity under takings, an energy consumer chec klist 
that provid es consumers with practical information about their rights. That chec klist should be kept up to date, 
provid ed to all consumers and made publicly available. 
(32)  Several factors impede consumers from accessing, understanding and acting upon the various sources of mark et 
information available to them. It follo ws that the compara bility of offers should be improved and barriers to 
switc hing should be minimised to the greatest practicable exte nt without unduly limiting consumer choice. 
(33)  Smaller customer s are still being charged a broad rang e of fees directly or indirectly as a result of switching 
supplier . Such fees make it more difficult to identify the best product or service and diminish the immediate 
financia l advantag e of switching. Although removi ng such fees might limit consumer choice by eliminating 
products based on rewarding consumer loyalty , restr icting their use further should impro ve consumer welfare, 
consumer engag ement and compet ition in the market. 
(34)  Shor ter switc hing times are likely to encourag e consumers to search for better energy deals and switc h supplier . 
With the increased deplo yment of information technology , by the year 2026, the technical switch ing process of 
registering a new supplier in a meter ing point at the mark et operator should typically be possible to compl ete 
within 24 hours on any working day. Notwithstanding other steps in the switching process that are to be 
compl eted before the technical process of switch ing is initiated, ensur ing that it is possible by that date for the 
technical process of switc hing to take place within 24 hours would minimise switc hing times, helping to increase 
consumer engag ement and retail competition. In any event, the tota l duration of the switc hing process should 
not exceed three weeks from the date of the customer 's request. 
(35)  Independent compari son tools, including websites , are an effective means for smaller customers to assess the 
mer its of the different energy offers that are available on the market. Such tools lower search costs as custome rs 
no long er need to collect information from individual suppliers and service providers. Such tools can provi de the 
right balance between the need for information to be clear and concise and the need for it to be complet e and 
compre hensive. They should aim to include the broadest possible range of available offers, and to cover the 
mark et as complet ely as is feasible so as to give the customer a representative overview . It is crucial that smaller 
custome rs have access to at least one compari son tool and that the information given on such tools be 
trustwor thy, impartial and transparent. To that end, Member States could provide for a compari son tool that is 
operat ed by a national author ity or a private compan y. 
(36)  Greate r consumer prot ection is guarant eed by the availability of effective, independent out-of-cour t dispute 
settlement mec hanisms for all consumers, such as an energy ombudsman, a consumer body or a regulator y 
author ity. Member States should introduce speedy and effective compl aint-handling procedures. 
(37)  All consumers should be able to benefi t from directly participating in the market, in particular by adjusting their 
consum ption according to mark et signals and, in retur n, benefi ting from lower electr icity prices or other 
incentive payments. The benefi ts of such active participation are likely to increase over time, as the aware ness of 
other wise passive consumers is raised about their possibilities as active custome rs and as the information on the 
possibilities of active participation becomes more accessible and better known. Consumers should have the 
possibility of participating in all forms of demand response. They should theref ore have the possibility of 
benefiting from the full deplo yment of smar t meter ing systems and, where such deplo yment has been negativ ely 
assessed, of choosing to have a smar t mete ring system and a dynamic electr icity price contract. This should allow 
them to adjust their consump tion according to real-time price signals that reflect the value and cost of electr icity 
or transpor tation in different time periods, while Member States should ensure the reasonable exposure of 14.6.2019 L 158/129 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     consumers to wholesale price risk. Consumers should be informed about benefits and poten tial price risks of 
dynamic electr icity price contracts. Member State s should also ensure that those consumers who choose not to 
actively engag e in the mark et are not penalised. Inste ad, their ability to make informed decisions on the options 
available to them should be facilitated in the manner that is the most suited to domestic mark et conditions. 
(38)  In order to maximise the benefits and effectiveness of dynamic electr icity pricing, Member States should assess 
the poten tial for making more dynamic or reducing the share of fixed components in electr icity bills, and where 
such potential exists, should take appropr iate action. 
(39)  All customer groups (industr ial, commercial and households) should have access to the electr icity markets to 
trade their flexibility and self-generat ed electr icity . Customers should be allowed to mak e full use of the 
advantag es of aggregation of production and supply over larger regions and benefit from cross-border 
competiti on. Mark et participants engag ed in aggreg ation are likely to play an important role as interm ediar ies 
between customer groups and the market. Member States should be free to choose the appropr iate implemen ­
tation model and approac h to govern ance for independent aggreg ation while respecting the general principles set 
out in this Directive. Such a model or approach could include choosing mark et-based or regulatory principles 
whic h provid e solutions to compl y with this Directive, such as models where imbalances are settled or where 
perimete r corrections are introduced. The chosen model should contain transparent and fair rules to allow 
independent aggregat ors to fulfil their roles as interm ediar ies and to ensure that the final customer adequat ely 
benefits from their activities. Products should be defined on all electr icity mark ets, including ancillar y services 
and capacity mark ets, so as to encourage the participation of demand response. 
(40)  The Commission Communication of 20 July 2016, entitled ‘European Strategy for Low-Emissi on Mobility’, 
stresses the need for the decarbonisation of the transpor t sector and the reduction of its emissions, especially in 
urban areas, and highlights the important role that electromobility can play in contr ibuting to those 
objectives. Moreover , the deplo yment of electromobility constitutes an important element of the energy 
transition. Marke t rules set out in this Directive should theref ore contr ibut e to creating favour able conditions for 
electr ic vehicles of all kinds. In particular , they should ensure the effective deplo yment of publicly accessible and 
private recharging points for electr ic vehicles and should ensure the efficient integration of vehicle charging into 
the system. 
(41)  Demand response is pivotal to enabling the smar t charging of electr ic vehicles and thereb y enabling the effic ient 
integra tion of electr ic vehicles into the electr icity grid whic h will be crucial for the process of decarbonising 
transpor t. 
(42)  Consumers should be able to consume, to store and to sell self-generat ed electr icity to the market and to 
participat e in all electr icity mark ets by providing flexibility to the system , for instance through energy storag e, 
such as storage using electr ic vehicles, through demand response or through energy efficiency sche mes. New 
technology developments will facilita te those activities in the future. However , legal and commercial barriers 
exist, including, for example, dispropor tionate fees for intern ally consumed electr icity , oblig ations to feed self- 
generated electr icity to the energy system, and administrative burdens, such as the need for consumers who self- 
generate electr icity and sell it to the system to compl y with the requirements for suppliers, etc. Such obstacles, 
whic h prevent consumers from self-generating electr icity and from consuming, stori ng or selling self-gener ated 
electr icity to the mark et, should be remo ved while it should be ensured that such consumers contr ibut e 
adequate ly to syste m costs. Member State s should be able to have differ ent provi sions in their national law with 
respect to taxes and levies for individual and jointly-acting active customer s, as well as for household and other 
final custom ers. 
(43)  Distr ibut ed energy technologies and consumer empo werment have made community energy an effective and 
cost-efficient way to meet citizens' needs and expectations regarding energy sources, services and local participa ­
tion. Community energy offers an inclusive option for all consumers to have a direct stak e in producing, 
consuming or shar ing energy . Community energy initiatives focus primar ily on providing affordable energy of 
a specifi c kind, such as renewable energy , for their members or shareholders rather than on prioritising prof it- 
making like a traditional electr icity under taking. By directly engaging with consumers, community energy 
initiatives demonstrat e their poten tial to facilitat e the uptak e of new technologies and consump tion patter ns, 14.6.2019 L 158/130 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     including smar t distr ibution grids and demand response, in an integrat ed manner . Community energy can also 
advance energy efficiency at household level and help fight energy poverty through reduced consum ption and 
lower supply tariffs. Community energy also enables certain groups of household customers to participat e in the 
electr icity markets, who other wise might not have been able to do so. Where they have been successfully 
operat ed such initiatives have delivered economic, social and envi ronmental benefits to the community that go 
beyond the mere benefits derived from the provi sion of energy services. This Directive aims to recognise certain 
catego ries of citizen energy initiatives at the Union level as ‘citizen energy communities’, in order to provide them 
with an enabling framework, fair treatment, a level playing field and a well-def ined catalogue of rights and 
oblig ations. Household custome rs should be allowe d to participate voluntar ily in community energy initiatives as 
well as to leave them, without losing access to the netw ork operat ed by the community energy initiative or losing 
their rights as consumers. Access to a citizen energy community's netw ork should be granted on fair and cost- 
reflective term s. 
(44)  Membership of citizen energy communities should be open to all cate gories of entities. However , the decision- 
making powers within a citizen energy community should be limited to those members or shareholders that are 
not engag ed in large-scale commercial activity and for which the energy sector does not constitut e a primar y area 
of economic activity . Citizen energy communities are considered to be a catego ry of cooperation of citizens or 
local actors that should be subject to recognition and prote ction under Union law. The provisions on citizen 
energy communities do not preclude the existen ce of other citizen initiatives such as those stem ming from 
private law agreements. It should theref ore be possible for Member States to provid e that citizen energy 
communities take any form of entity , for exam ple that of an association, a cooperative, a partnership, a non- 
profit organisation or a small or medium-sized enterprise, provid ed that the entity is entitled to exer cise rights 
and be subject to obligations in its own name. 
(45)  The provisions of this Directive on citizen energy communities provide for rights and oblig ations, which are 
possible to deduce from other , existing rights and oblig ations, such as the freedom of contract, the right to 
switc h supplier , the responsibilities of the distr ibution system operat or, the rules on netw ork charges , and 
balancing obligations. 
(46)  Citizen energy communities constitute a new type of entity due to their membership structure, govern ance 
requirements and purpose. They should be allowe d to operate on the mark et on a level playing field without 
distor ting competition, and the rights and oblig ations applicable to the other electr icity under takings on the 
mark et should be applied to citizen energy communities in a non-discr iminator y and propor tionate manner . 
Those rights and obligations should apply in accordance with the roles that they under take , such as the roles of 
final customer s, producers, suppliers or distr ibution system operat ors. Citizen energy communities should not 
face regulatory restr ictions when they apply existing or future information and communications technologies to 
share electr icity produced using generation assets within the citizen energy community among their members or 
shareholders based on market principles, for exam ple by offsetting the energy component of members or 
shareholders using the generation available within the community , even over the public netw ork, provi ded that 
both meter ing points belong to the community . Electr icity shar ing enables members or shareholders to be 
supplied with electr icity from generating installations within the community without being in direct physical 
proximity to the generating installation and without being behind a sing le metering point. Where electr icity is 
shared, the shar ing should not affect the collection of netw ork charges, tariffs and levies relat ed to electr icity 
flows. The shar ing should be facilitated in accordance with the oblig ations and correct timeframes for balancing, 
metering and settlement. The provisions of this Directive on citizen energy communities do not interfe re with the 
compet ence of Member States to design and implement policies relating to the energy sector in relation to 
netw ork charges and tariffs, or to design and implement energy policy financing systems and cost shar ing, 
provid ed that those policies are non-discr iminator y and lawful. 
(47)  This Directive empo wers Member States to allow citizen energy communities to become distr ibution system 
operat ors either under the general regime or as ‘closed distr ibution system operat ors’. Once a citizen energy 
community is grant ed the status of a distr ibution syste m operat or, it should be treated as, and be subject to the 
same oblig ations as, a distr ibution syste m operat or. The provisions of this Directive on citizen energy 
communities only clarify aspects of distr ibution system operation that are likely to be relevant for citizen energy 
communities, while other aspects of distr ibution system operation apply in accordance with the rules relating to 
distr ibution system operat ors. 14.6.2019 L 158/131 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     (48)  Electr icity bills are an important means by whic h final custom ers are informed. As well as provid ing data on 
consum ption and costs, they can also conve y other information that helps consumers to compare their current 
arrang ements with other offers. However , disputes over bills are a very common source of consumer compl aints, 
a factor which contr ibut es to the persist ently low levels of consumer satisfaction and engag ement in the 
electr icity sector . It is theref ore necessar y to make bills clearer and easier to understand, as well as to ensure that 
bills and billing information prominently displa y a limited number of impor tant items of information that are 
necessar y to enable consumers to regulate their energy consum ption, compare offers and switch supplier . Other 
items of information should be made available to final customer s in, with or sign posted to within their bills. Such 
items should be displa yed on the bill or be in a separate document attached to the bill, or the bill should contain 
a reference to where the final customer is easily able to find the information on a website , through a mobile 
application or by other means. 
(49)  The regular provision of accurate billing information based on actual electr icity consump tion, facilitated by smar t 
metering, is important for helping customer s to control their electr icity consum ption and costs. Never theless, 
custome rs, in particular household customers, should have access to flexible arrang ements for the actual payment 
of their bills. For example, it could be possible for customer s to be provided with frequent billing information, 
while paying only on a quar terly basis, or there could be products for which the customer pays the same amount 
ever y month, independently of the actual consum ption. 
(50)  The provisions on billing in Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (8) should be 
updat ed, streamlined and mov ed to this Directive, where they fit more coherently . 
(51)  Member States should encourage the moder nisation of distr ibution netw orks, such as through the introduction of 
smar t grids, whic h should be built in a way that encourages decentralised generation and energy efficiency . 
(52)  Engag ing consumers requires appropr iate incentives and technologies such as smar t meter ing systems . Smar t 
metering systems empo wer consumers because they allow them to receive accurat e and near real-time feedback 
on their energy consum ption or generation, and to manage their consum ption better, to participate in and reap 
benefits from demand response programmes and other services, and to lower their electr icity bills. Smar t 
metering systems also enable distr ibution system operat ors to have better visibility of their netw orks, and as 
a consequence, to reduce their operation and maintenance costs and to pass those savings on to the consumers 
in the form of lower distr ibution tariffs. 
(53)  When it comes to deciding at national level on the deplo yment of smar t metering systems , it should be possible 
to base this decision on an economic assessment. That economic assessment should take into account the long- 
term benefi ts of the deplo yment of smar t meter ing systems to consumers and the whole value chain, such as 
better network management, more precise planning and identification of netw ork losses. Should that assessment 
conclude that the introduction of such metering syste ms is cost-eff ective only for consumers with a certain 
amount of electr icity consump tion, Member States should be able to take that conclusion into account when 
proceeding with the deplo yment of smar t metering system s. However , such assessments should be reviewed 
regularly in response to signif icant changes in the underlying assump tions, or at least ever y four years, given the 
fast pace of technological developments. 
(54)  Member State s that do not systematically deplo y smar t metering systems should allow consumers to benefi t from 
the installation of a smar t mete r, upon request and under fair and reasonable conditions, and should provi de 
them with all the relevant information. Where consumers do not have smar t mete rs, they should be entitled to 
meters that fulfil the minimum requirements necessar y to provide them with the billing information specified in 
this Directive. 14.6.2019 L 158/132 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     
(8)Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on energy efficiency , amending Directives 
2009/125/EC and 2010/30/EU and repealing Directives 2004/8/EC and 2006/32/EC (OJ L 315, 14.11.2012, p. 1). (55)  In order to assist consumers' active participation in the electr icity markets, the smar t meter ing syste ms to be 
deplo yed by Member State s in their territory should be interoperable, and should be able to provi de data required 
for consumer energy management system s. To that end, Member States should have due regar d to the use of 
relevant available standards, including standards that enable inter operability on the level of the data model and 
the application layer, to best practices and the importance of the development of data exchange, to future and 
inno vative energy services, to the deplo yment of smar t grids and to the internal market for electr icity . Moreover , 
the smar t meter ing systems that are deplo yed should not represent a barrier to switching supplier , and should be 
equipped with fit-for-pur pose functionalities that allow consumers to have near real-time access to their 
consum ption data, to modulat e their energy consump tion and, to the extent that the suppor ting infrastr ucture 
permits, to offer their flexibility to the netw ork and to electr icity under takings and to be rewarded for it, and to 
obtain savings in their electr icity bills. 
(56)  A key aspect of supplying custome rs is provid ing access to objective and transparent consum ption data. Thus, 
consumers should have access to their consump tion data and to the prices and service costs associated with their 
consum ption, so that they can invite competit ors to make offers based on that information. Consumers should 
also have the right to be properly informed about their energy consum ption. Prepa yments should not place 
a dispropor tionat e disadvantag e on their users, while different payment systems should be non-discr iminator y. 
The information on energy costs that is provided to consumers suffi ciently frequently would creat e incentives for 
energy savings because it would give customer s direct feedbac k on the effects of investment in energy efficiency 
and on changes of behaviour . In that respect, the full imple mentation of Directive 2012/27/EU will help 
consumers to reduce their energy costs. 
(57)  Currently , diffe rent models for the manag ement of data have been developed or are under development in 
Member States followi ng deplo yment of smar t metering systems. Independently of the data management model it 
is important that Member State s put in place transparent rules under whic h data can be accessed under non-dis ­
criminato ry conditions and ensure the highest level of cybersecur ity and data protection as well as the 
impartiality of the entities which process data. 
(58)  Member States should take the necessar y measures to prote ct vulnerable and energy poor customer s in the 
cont ext of the internal mark et for electr icity . Such measures may differ according to the particular circumstances 
in the Member States in question and may include social or energy policy measures relating to the payment of 
electr icity bills, to inve stment in the energy efficiency of residential buildings, or to consumer protect ion such as 
disconnection safeguards. Where universal service is also provid ed to small enterpr ises, measures to ensure 
universal service provi sion may differ according to whether those measures are aimed at household customers or 
small enter prises. 
(59)  Energy services are fundamental to safeguarding the well-being of the Union citizens. Adequate warmth, cooling 
and lighting, and energy to power appliances are essential services to guarant ee a decent standard of living and 
citizens' health. Further more, access to those energy services enables Union citizens to fulfil their pote ntial and 
enhances social inclusion. Energy poor households are unable to afford those energy services due to 
a combination of low income, high expenditure on energy and poor energy efficiency of their homes. Member 
States should collect the right information to monit or the number of households in energy poverty. Accurate 
measurement should assist Member States in identifying households that are affected by energy pover ty in order 
to provid e target ed suppor t. The Commission should actively suppor t the imple mentation of the provi sions of 
this Directive on energy pover ty by facilitating the shar ing of good practices between Member States. 
(60)  Where Member States are affect ed by energy poverty and have not developed national action plans or other 
appropr iate framewor ks to tackle energy poverty, they should do so, with the aim of decreasing the number of 
energy poor customer s. Low income, high expenditure on energy , and poor energy efficiency of homes are 
relevant factors in establishing criteria for the measurement of energy poverty. In any event, Member States 
should ensure the necessar y supply for vulnerable and energy poor customer s. In doing so, an integrat ed 
approac h, such as in the framew ork of energy and social policy , could be used and measures could include social 
policies or energy efficiency improvements for housing. This Directive should enhance national policies in favour 
of vulnerable and energy poor customer s. 14.6.2019 L 158/133 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     (61)  Distr ibution system operat ors have to cost-effic iently integrat e new electr icity generation, especially installations 
generating electr icity from renewable sources, and new loads such as loads that result from heat pumps and 
electr ic vehicles. For that purpose, distr ibution system operat ors should be enabled, and provid ed with incentives, 
to use services from distr ibuted energy resources such as demand response and energy storag e, based on mark et 
procedures, in order to efficiently operat e their networks and to avoid costly netw ork expansions. Member States 
should put in place appropr iate measures such as national netw ork codes and mark et rules, and should provi de 
incentives to distr ibution system operators through netw ork tariffs whic h do not creat e obstacles to flexibility or 
to the improvement of energy efficiency in the grid. Member States should also introduce netw ork development 
plans for distr ibution systems in order to suppor t the integration of installations generating electr icity from 
renewable energy sources, facilitate the development of energy stora ge facilities and the electr ification of the 
transpor t sector, and provide to system users adequate information regarding the anticipated expansions or 
upgrades of the network, as currently such procedures do not exist in the major ity of Member States. 
(62)  System operat ors should not own, develop, manage or operate energy storag e facilities. In the new electr icity 
mark et design, energy storage services should be mark et-based and competitive. Consequently , cross-subsidisation 
between energy storag e and the regulated functions of distr ibution or transmission should be avoided. Such 
restr ictions on the ownership of energy storag e facilities is to prevent distor tion of compe tition, to eliminate the 
risk of discr imination, to ensure fair access to energy stora ge services to all market participants and to foste r the 
effective and efficient use of energy storage facilities, beyond the operation of the distr ibution or transmission 
system . That requirement should be interpreted and applied in accordance with the rights and principles 
established under the Char ter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ‘Char ter’), in particular the 
freedom to conduct a business and the right to proper ty guaranteed by Articles 16 and 17 of the Char ter. 
(63)  Where energy storage facilities are fully integrat ed netw ork compo nents that are not used for balancing or for 
cong estion manage ment, they should not, subject to approval by the regulatory author ity, be required to comply 
with the same strict limitations for system operat ors to own, develop, manage or operat e those facilities. Such 
fully integrat ed netw ork components can include energy storag e facilities such as capacit ors or flywheels which 
provid e impor tant services for netw ork secur ity and reliability , and contr ibut e to the synch ronisation of diffe rent 
parts of the system . 
(64)  With the objective of progress towards a compl etely decarbonised electr icity sector that is fully free of emissions, 
it is necessar y to make progress in seasonal energy storag e. Such energy storage is an element that would serve as 
a tool for the operation of the electr icity syste m to allow for shor t-term and seasonal adjustment, in order to 
cope with variability in the production of electr icity from renewable sources and the associated contingenc ies in 
those horizons. 
(65)  Non-discr iminato ry access to the distr ibution netw ork determines downstream access to customer s at retail level. 
To create a level playing field at retail level, the activities of distr ibution system operat ors should theref ore be 
monitor ed so that distr ibution system operat ors are prevented from taking advantage of their vertical integration 
as regards their compet itive position on the mark et, in particular in relation to household customer s and small 
non-household custome rs. 
(66)  Where a closed distr ibution syste m is used to ensure the optimal efficiency of an integrated supply that requires 
specific operational standards, or where a closed distr ibution system is maintained primar ily for the use of the 
owner of the system, it should be possible to exem pt the distr ibution system operat or from oblig ations whic h 
would constitute an unnecessar y administrative burden because of the particular nature of the relationship 
between the distr ibution system operat or and the system users. Industr ial sites, commercial sites or shared 
services sites such as train station buildings, airports, hospitals, large camping sites with integrat ed facilities, and 
chemical industr y sites can include closed distr ibution systems because of the specialised nature of their 
operations. 
(67)  Without the effective separation of netw orks from activities of generation and supply (effective unbundling), there 
is an inherent risk of discr imination not only in the operation of the netw ork but also in the incentives for 
vertically integrated under takings to invest adequately in their netw orks. 14.6.2019 L 158/134 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     (68)  Only the remo val of the incentive for vertically integrated under takings to discr iminate against competit ors as 
regar ds netw ork access and investment can ensure effective unbundling. Ownership unbundling, whic h implies 
the appointment of the netw ork owner as the system operat or and its independence from any supply and 
production interests, is clearly an effective and stable way to solve the inherent conf lict of interests and to ensure 
secur ity of supply . For that reason, the European Parliament, in its resolution of 10 July 2007 on prospects for 
the internal gas and electr icity mark et, refer red to ownership unbundling at transmission level as the most 
effective tool for promoting investments in infrastr ucture in a non-discr iminato ry way, fair access to the netw ork 
for new entrants and transparency in the market. Under ownership unbundling, Member States should theref ore 
be required to ensure that the same person or persons are not entitled to exercise control over a producer or 
supplier and, at the same time, exercise control or any right over a transmission system operat or or transmission 
system . Conv ersely , control over a transmission system operator or transmission system should preclude the 
possibility of exer cising control or any right over a producer or supplier . Within those limits, a producer or 
supplier should be able to have a minor ity shareholding in a transmission system operat or or transmission 
system . 
(69)  Any system for unbundling should be effective in removi ng any conf lict of interests between producers, suppliers 
and transmission system operat ors, in order to creat e incentives for the necessar y investments and to guarantee 
the access of new market entrants under a transparent and efficient regulatory regime and should not create an 
overly onerous regulatory regime for regulatory author ities. 
(70)  Since ownership unbundling requires the restr uctur ing of under takings in some instances, Member States that 
decide to implement ownership unbundling should be granted additional time to apply the relevant provi sions. In 
view of the vertical link s between the electr icity and gas sector s, the unbundling provisions should apply across 
the two sector s. 
(71)  Under ownership unbundling, to ensure full independence of netw ork operation from supply and generation 
inter ests, and to prevent exchange s of any confidential information, the same person should not be a member of 
the managing board of both a transmission system operat or or a transmission system and an under taking 
performin g any of the functions of generation or supply . For the same reason, the same person should not be 
entitled to appoint members of the managing boards of a transmission system operat or or a transmission system 
and to exercise control or any right over a producer or supplier . 
(72)  The setting up of a system operator or transmission operat or that is independent from supply and generation 
inter ests should enable a vertically integrat ed under taking to maintain its ownership of netw ork assets while 
ensur ing the effective separation of interests, provid ed that such independent system operat or or independent 
transmission operat or performs all of the functions of a syste m operat or, and provided that detailed regulation 
and extensive regulatory control mech anisms are put in place. 
(73)  Where, on 3 Septembe r 2009, an under taking owning a transmission system was part of a vertically integrat ed 
under taking, Member State s should be given a choice between ownership unbundling and setting up a system 
operat or or transmission operat or whic h is independent from supply and generation inter ests. 
(74)  To preser ve fully the interests of the shareholders of vertically integrated under takings, Member States should 
have the choice of implementing ownership unbundling either by direct divestments or by splitting the shares of 
the integrat ed under taking into shares of a netw ork under taking and shares of a remaining supply and generation 
under taking, provid ed that the requirements resulting from ownership unbundling are compl ied with. 
(75)  The full effectiveness of the independent system operat or or independent transmission operat or solutions should 
be ensured by way of specifi c additional rules. The rules on independent transmission operators provide an 
appropr iate regulatory framew ork to guarant ee fair compet ition, suffic ient investment, access for new mark et 
entrants and integrat ion of electr icity mark ets. Effective unbundling through provisions on independent 
transmission operat ors should be based on a pillar of organisational measures and measures relating to the 
governance of transmission system operat ors and on a pillar of measures relating to inve stment, to connecting 
new production capacities to the netw ork and to mark et integration through regional cooperation. The 
independence of transmission operat ors should also be ensured, inter alia, through certain ‘cooling-off’ periods 
during which no manage ment or other relevant activity giving access to the same information that could have 
been obtained in a manag erial position is exercised in the vertically integrat ed under taking. 14.6.2019 L 158/135 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     (76)  Member State s have the right to opt for full ownership unbundling in their territory. Where a Member State has 
exer cised that right, an under taking does not have the right to set up an independent system operat or or an 
independent transmission operat or. Further more, an under taking performin g any of the functions of generation 
or supply cannot directly or indirectly exercise control or any right over a transmission system operator from 
a Member State that has opted for full ownership unbundling. 
(77)  The implementation of effective unbundling should respect the principle of non-discr imination between the 
public and private sector s. To that end, the same person should not be able to exercise control or any right, in 
violation of the rules of ownership unbundling or the independent system operator option, solely or jointly , over 
the composition, voting or decisions of both the bodies of the transmission system operators or the transmission 
system s and the bodies of the producer or supplier . With rega rd to ownership unbundling and the independent 
system operator solution, provided that the relevant Member State is able to demonstrate that the relevant 
requirements have been compl ied with, two separate public bodies should be able to control generation and 
supply activities, on the one hand, and transmission activities, on the other . 
(78)  Fully effective separation of netw ork activities from supply and generation activities should apply throughout the 
Union to both Union and non-Union under takings. To ensure that netw ork activities and supply and generation 
activities throughout the Union remain independent from each other , regulatory author ities should be 
emp owered to refuse to certify transmission system operat ors that do not compl y with the unbundling rules. To 
ensure the consist ent application of those rules across the Union, the regulatory author ities should take the 
utmost account of Commission opinions when they take decisions on certificat ion. In addition, to ensure respect 
for the intern ational oblig ations of the Union, and to ensure solidar ity and energy secur ity within the Union, the 
Commission should have the right to give an opinion on certification in relation to a transmission syste m owner 
or a transmission system operat or which is controlled by a person or persons from a third countr y or third 
countr ies. 
(79)  Author isation procedures should not lead to administrative burdens that are dispropor tionate to the size and 
poten tial impact of the producers. Unduly lengthy author isation procedures may constitut e a barrier to access for 
new mark et entrants. 
(80)  Regulat ory author ities need to be able to take decisions in relation to all relevant regulatory issues if the intern al 
mark et for electr icity is to function properly , and need to be fully independent from any other public or private 
inter ests. This precludes neither judicial review nor parliamentar y super vision in accordance with the constitu ­
tional laws of the Member States. In addition, the approval of the budget of the regulatory author ity by the 
national legislator does not constitute an obstacle to budgetary autonom y. The provisions relating to the 
auton omy in the implementation of the allocated budget of the regulatory author ity should be implemen ted in 
the framew ork defined by national budgetary law and rules. While contr ibuting to the regulatory author ities' 
independence from any political or economic inter est through an appropr iate rotation scheme, it should be 
possible for Member State s to take due account of the availability of human resources and of the size of the 
board. 
(81)  Regulat ory author ities should be able to fix or appro ve tariffs, or the methodologies underlying the calculation of 
the tariffs, on the basis of a proposal by the transmission system operat or or distr ibution system operat ors, or on 
the basis of a proposal agreed between those operators and the users of the netw ork. In carrying out those tasks, 
regulatory author ities should ensure that transmission and distr ibution tariffs are non-discr iminato ry and cost- 
reflective, and should take account of the long-term, marginal, avoided netw ork costs from distr ibut ed generation 
and demand-side management measures. 
(82)  Regulat ory author ities should fix or approve individual grid tariffs for transmission and distr ibution netw orks or 
a methodology , or both. In either case, the independence of the regulator y author ities in setting network tariffs 
pursuant to point (b)(ii) of Article 57(4) should be preser ved. 
(83)  Regulat ory author ities should ensure that transmission system operat ors and distr ibution system operat ors take 
appropr iate measures to mak e their netw ork more resilient and flexible. To that end, they should monitor those 
operat ors' performa nce based on indicator s such as the capability of transmission system operat ors and 
distr ibution system operat ors to operat e lines under dynamic line rating, the development of remote monitori ng 
and real-time control of substations, the reduction of grid losses and the frequency and duration of power 
interr upti ons. 14.6.2019 L 158/136 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     (84)  Regulat ory author ities should have the power to issue binding decisions in relation to electr icity under takings 
and to impose effective, propor tionate and dissuasive penalties on electr icity under takings which fail to comply 
with their obligations or to propose that a compet ent cour t impose such penalties on them. To that end, 
regulatory author ities should be able to request relevant information from electr icity under takings, to conduct 
appropr iate and suffi cient investig ations, and to settle disputes. Regulator y author ities should also be grant ed the 
power to decide, irrespective of the application of competition rules, on appropr iate measures that ensure 
custome r benefits through the promotion of effective competition necessar y for the proper functioning of the 
internal mark et for electr icity . 
(85)  Regulat ory author ities should coordinate among themselves when carrying out their task s to ensure that the 
European Network of Transmission System Operato rs for Electr icity (the ‘ENTSO for Electr icity’), the European 
Entity for Distr ibution Syste m Operato rs (the ‘EU DSO entity’), and the regional coordination centres comply 
with their oblig ations under the regulatory framework of the internal mark et for electr icity , and with decisions of 
the Age ncy for the Cooperation of Energy Regulat ors (ACER), established by Regulation (EU) 2019/942 of the 
European Parliament and of the Council (9). With the expansion of the operational responsibilities of the ENTSO 
for Electr icity , the EU DSO entity and the regional coordination centres, it is necessar y to enhance oversight with 
regar d to entities that operat e at Union or regional level. Regulat ory author ities should consult each other and 
should coordinate their oversight to jointly identify situations where the ENTSO for Electr icity , the EU DSO entity 
or the regional coordination centres do not compl y with their respective oblig ations. 
(86)  Regulat ory author ities should also be granted the power to contr ibut e to ensur ing high standards of universal 
and public service obligations in accordance with mark et opening, to the protection of vulnerable customer s, and 
to the full effectiveness of consumer prot ection measures. Those provisions should be without prejudice to both 
the Commission's powers concer ning the application of compet ition rules, including the examination of merge rs 
with a Union dimension, and the rules on the internal market, such as the rules on the free mov ement of capital. 
The independent body to which a party affect ed by the decision of a regulatory author ity has a right to appeal 
could be a cour t or another tribunal that is empo wered to conduct a judicial review . 
(87)  This Directive and Directive 2009/73/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (10) do not depr ive 
Member States of the possibility of establishing and issuing their national energy policy . It follows that, 
depending on a Member State 's constitutional arrange ments, it might be within Member State's compet ence to 
determine the policy framework in which the regulatory author ities are to operate, for example concer ning 
secur ity of supply . However , the general energy policy guidelines issued by the Member State should not imping e 
on the independence or auton omy of the regulatory author ities. 
(88)  Regulation (EU) 2019/943 provides for the Commission to adopt guidelines or netw ork codes to achi eve the 
necessar y degree of harmonisation. Such guidelines and network codes constitute binding implementing 
measures and, with regard to certain provisions of this Directive, are a useful tool that can be adap ted quic kly 
where necessar y. 
(89)  Member State s and the Contracting Parties to the Treaty establishing the Energy Community (11) should cooperate 
closely on all matt ers concer ning the development of an integrat ed electr icity trading region and should take no 
measures that endang er the further integration of electr icity markets or the secur ity of supply of Member States 
and Contracting Parties. 
(90)  This Directive should be read together with Regulation (EU) 2019/943, which lays down the key principles of the 
new mark et design for electr icity which will enable bette r rewards for flexibility , provide adequate price signals, 
and ensure the development of functioning integrated shor t-term mark ets. Regulation (EU) 2019/943 also sets 
out new rules in various areas, including on capacity mec hanisms and cooperation between transmission system 
operat ors. 14.6.2019 L 158/137 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

(11)OJ L 198, 20.7.2006, p. 18. (91)  This Directive respects the fundamental rights and obser ves the principles recognised in the Char ter. According ly, 
this Directive should be interpret ed and applied in accordance with those rights and principles, in particular the 
right to the prot ection of personal data guarant eed by Article 8 of the Char ter. It is essential that any processing 
of personal data under this Directive compl y with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of 
the Council (12). 
(92)  In order to provid e the minimum degree of harmonisation required to achieve the aim of this Directive, the 
power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegat ed to the Commission to establish 
rules on the extent of the duties of the regulatory author ities to cooperate with each other and with ACER and 
setting out the details of the procedure for compl iance with the netw ork codes and guidelines. It is of particular 
importance that the Commission carry out appropr iate consultations during its preparatory work, including at 
exper t level, and that those consultations be conduct ed in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interin­
stitutional Agreement of 13 Apr il 2016 on Better Law-Making (13). In particular , to ensure equal participation in 
the preparation of delegat ed acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same 
time as Member States' exper ts, and their exper ts system atically have access to meetings of Commission exper t 
groups dealing with the preparation of the delegat ed acts. 
(93)  In order to ensure unif orm conditions for the implementation of this Directive, implementing powers should be 
conferred on the Commission to determine inter operability requirements and non-discr iminato ry and transparent 
procedures for access to meter ing data, consum ption data, as well as data required for customer switc hing, 
demand response and other services. Those powers should be exer cised in accordance with Regulation (EU) 
No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (14). 
(94)  Where a derogat ion applies pursuant to Article 66(3), (4) or (5), that deroga tion should also cover any provisions 
in this Directive that are ancillar y to, or that require the prior application of, any of the provisions from whic h it 
has been grant ed a derogat ion. 
(95)  The provisions of Directive 2012/27/EU relat ed to electr icity markets, such as the provisions on metering and 
billing of electr icity , demand response, priority dispatch and grid access for high-eff iciency coge neration, are 
updat ed by the provisions laid down in this Directive and in Regulation (EU) 2019/943. Directive 2012/27/EU 
should theref ore be amended according ly. 
(96)  Since the objective of this Directive, namely the creation of a fully operational intern al mark et for electr icity , 
cannot be suffi ciently achieve d by the Member State s but can rather , by the reasons of its scale and effects, be 
better achi eved at Union level, the Union may adop t measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiar ity as 
set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on the European Union. In accordance with the principle of propor tionality as 
set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessar y in order to achi eve that objective. 
(97)  In accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of 28 Sept ember 2011 of Member States and the Commission 
on explanato ry documents (15), Member States have under taken to accompan y, in justified cases, the notification 
of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the 
compo nents of a directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instr uments. With regard to this 
Directive, the legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be justified. 
(98)  The obligation to transpose this Directive into national law should be conf ined to those provisions which 
represent a substantive amendment as compared to Directive 2009/72/EC. The oblig ation to transpose the

(99)  This Directive should be without prejudice to the oblig ations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for

costs for consumers, a high degree of secur ity of supply and a smooth transition towards a sustainable low-carbon 
energy system. It lays down key rules relating to the organisation and functioning of the Union electr icity sector , in 
particular rules on consumer empower ment and protect ion, on open access to the integrat ed market, on third-par ty 
access to transmission and distr ibution infrastr ucture, unbundling requirements, and rules on the independence of 
regulatory author ities in the Member States. 
This Directive also sets out modes for Member States, regulatory author ities and transmission system operat ors to 
cooperat e towards the creation of a fully inter connected internal mark et for electr icity that increases the integration of 
electr icity from renewable sources, free competiti on and secur ity of supply .

a fair tendering procedure. 
4. Where Member States have implemented the conditions set out in paragraph 3, Member States or their designat ed 
compet ent author ities shall perform, at regular inter vals or at least ever y five years, a public consultation in order to re- 
assess the potential interest of other parties in owning, developing, operating or managing recharging points for electr ic 
vehicles. Where the public consultation indicate s that other parties are able to own, develop, operat e or manage such 
points, Member States shall ensure that distr ibution syste m operat ors' activities in this regard are phased-out, subject to 
the successful compl etion of the tenderi ng procedure refer red to in point (a) of paragraph 3. As part of the conditions 
of that procedure, regulatory author ities may allow the distr ibution system operat or to recover the residual value of its 
investment in rech arging infrastr ucture. 
Article 34 
Tasks of distribution system operat ors in data management 
Member State s shall ensure that all eligible parties have non-discr iminato ry access to data under clear and equal terms, 
in accordance with the relevant data protect ion rules. In Member State s where smar t metering system s have been 
deplo yed in accordance with Article 19 and where distr ibution system operat ors are involved in data management, the 
compl iance programmes referred to in point (d) of Article 35(2) shall include specific measures in order to excl ude dis­
criminato ry access to data from eligible parties as provid ed for in Article 23. Where distr ibution system operat ors are 
not subject to Article 35(1), (2) or (3), Member States shall take all necessar y measures to ensure that vertically 
integrat ed under takings do not have privileg ed access to data for the conduct of their supply activities. 
Article 35 
Unbundling of distribution system operat ors 
1. Where the distr ibution system operator is part of a vertically integrat ed under taking, it shall be independent at 
least in term s of its legal form, orga nisation and decision-making from other activities not relating to distr ibution. Those 
rules shall not creat e an obligation to separate the ownership of assets of the distr ibution system operat or from the 
vertically integrated under taking. 
2. In addition to the requirements under paragraph 1, where the distr ibution system operat or is part of a vertically 
integrat ed under taking, it shall be independent in term s of its organisation and decision-making from the other activities 
not relat ed to distr ibution. In order to achi eve this, the followi ng minimum criteria shall apply: 
(a)  the persons responsible for the management of the distr ibution system operator must not participate in compan y 
structures of the integrat ed electr icity under taking responsible, directly or indirectly , for the day-to-da y operation of 
the generation, transmission or supply of electr icity ; 
(b)  appropr iate measures must be take n to ensure that the profess ional inter ests of the persons responsible for the 
manage ment of the distr ibution system operat or are taken into account in a manner that ensures that they are 
capable of acting independently ; 
(c)  the distr ibution system operat or must have effective decision-making rights, independent from the integrat ed 
electr icity under taking, with respect to assets necessar y to operate, maintain or develop the netw ork. In order to 
fulfil those tasks, the distr ibution system operat or shall have at its disposal the necessar y resources including human, 
technical, physical and financial resources. This should not prevent the existen ce of appropr iate coordination 
mechani sms to ensure that the economic and manag ement super vision rights of the parent compan y in respect of 
retur n on assets, regulated indirectly in accordance with Article 59(7), in a subsidiar y are prote cted. In particular , 
this shall enable the parent compan y to approve the annual financial plan, or any equivalent instr ument, of the 
distr ibution system operator and to set global limits on the levels of indebt edness of its subsidiar y. It shall not 
permit the parent compan y to give instr uctions regar ding day-to-da y operations, nor with respect to individual 
decisions concer ning the constr uction or upgrading of distr ibution lines, that do not excee d the term s of the 
approved financial plan, or any equivalent instr ument ; and 14.6.2019 L 158/161 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     (d)  the distr ibution system operat or must establish a compl iance programme, whic h sets out measures take n to ensure 
that discr iminato ry conduct is excl uded, and ensure that obser vance of it is adequat ely monitor ed. The compl iance 
programme shall set out the specifi c oblig ations of emplo yees to meet that objective. An annual repor t, setting out 
the measures take n, shall be submitted by the person or body responsible for monitori ng the compl iance 
programme, the compl iance office r of the distr ibution system operat or, to the regulatory author ity refer red to in 
Article 57(1) and shall be published. The compliance officer of the distr ibution system operator shall be fully 
independent and shall have access to all the necessar y information of the distr ibution system operat or and any 
affiliated under taking to fulfil its task. 
3. Where the distr ibution system operator is part of a vertically integrat ed under taking, the Member State s shall 
ensure that the activities of the distr ibution system operat or are monitored by regulatory author ities or other compet ent 
bodies so that it cannot take advantage of its vertical integration to distor t competition. In particular , vertically 
integrat ed distr ibution system operat ors shall not, in their communication and branding, creat e confusion with respect 
to the separate identity of the supply branch of the vertically integrated under taking. 
4. Member States may decide not to apply paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 to integrated electr icity under takings whic h serve 
less than 100 000 connecte d custome rs, or serving small isolated systems . 
Article 36 
Ownership of energy storage facilities by distribution system operat ors 
1. Distr ibution system operat ors shall not own, develop, manage or operat e energy storage facilities. 
2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, Member States may allow distr ibution system operators to own, develop, 
manage or operate energy storag e facilities, where they are fully integrat ed netw ork components and the regulatory 
author ity has granted its approval, or where all of the following conditions are fulfilled: 
(a)  other parties, followi ng an open, transparent and non-discr iminator y tenderi ng procedure that is subject to review 
and appro val by the regulatory author ity, have not been awar ded a right to own, develop, manage or operat e such 
facilities, or could not deliver those services at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner ; 
(b)  such facilities are necessar y for the distr ibution system operators to fulfil their obligations under this Directive for 
the efficient, reliable and secure operation of the distr ibution system and the facilities are not used to buy or sell 
electr icity in the electr icity markets; and 
(c)  the regulatory author ity has assessed the necessity of such a deroga tion and has carried out an assessment of the 
tendering procedure, including the conditions of the tendering procedure, and has grant ed its approval. 
The regulatory author ity may draw up guidelines or procurement clauses to help distr ibution syste m operators ensure 
a fair tendering procedure. 
3. The regulat ory author ities shall perform, at regular inter vals or at least ever y five years, a public consultation on 
the existing energy storag e facilities in order to assess the poten tial availability and inter est in inve sting in such 
facilities. Where the public consultation, as assessed by the regulatory author ity, indicates that third parties are able to 
own, develop, operat e or manage such facilities in a cost-eff ective manner , the regulatory author ity shall ensure that the 
distr ibution syste m operat ors' activities in this regar d are phased out within 18 months. As part of the conditions of 
that procedure, regulatory author ities may allow the distr ibution system operators to receive reasonable compen sation, 
in particular to reco ver the residual value of their investment in the energy storag e facilities. 
4. Paragraph 3 shall not apply to fully integrat ed netw ork compo nents or for the usual depreciation period of new 
batte ry stora ge facilities with a final investment decision until 4 July 2019, provided that such batte ry storag e facilities 
are: 
(a)  connected to the grid at the latest two years thereaf ter; 
(b)  integrat ed into the distr ibution system ; 14.6.2019 L 158/162 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     (c)  used only for the reactive instantaneous restoration of netw ork secur ity in the case of netw ork contingenc ies where 
such restoration measure starts immediat ely and ends when regular re-dispatch can solve the issue; and 
(d)  not used to buy or sell electr icity in the electr icity mark ets, including balancing. 
Article 37 
Conf identiality obligation of distr ibution system operat ors 
Without prejudice to Article 55 or another legal requirement to disclose information, the distr ibution system operat or 
shall preser ve the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information obtained in the course of carrying out its 
business, and shall prevent information about its own activities whic h may be commercially advantageous from being 
disclosed in a discr iminato ry manner . 
Article 38 
Closed distribution systems 
1. Member States may provide for regulator y author ities or other compet ent author ities to classify a system which 
distr ibut es electr icity within a geographically confined industr ial, commercial or shared services site and does not, 
without prejudice to paragraph 4, supply household customers, as a closed distr ibution system if: 
(a)  for specif ic technical or safet y reasons, the operations or the production process of the users of that system are 
integrat ed; or 
(b)  that system distr ibutes electr icity primar ily to the owner or operat or of the system or their related under takings. 
2. Closed distr ibution system s shall be considered to be distr ibution systems for the purposes of this Directive. 
Member States may provide for regulatory author ities to exem pt the operator of a closed distr ibution system from: 
(a)  the requirement under Article 31(5) and (7) to procure the energy it uses to cover energy losses and the non- 
frequency ancillar y services in its system in accordance with transparent, non-discr iminator y and mark et-based 
procedures; 
(b)  the requirement under Article 6(1) that tariffs, or the methodologies underlying their calculation, are approved in 
accordance with Article 59(1) prior to their entr y into force; 
(c)  the requirements under Article 32(1) to procure flexibility services and under Article 32(3) to develop the operator's 
system on the basis of netw ork development plans; 
(d)  the requirement under Article 33(2) not to own, develop, manage or operat e rech arging points for electr ic vehicles; 
and 
(e)  the requirement under Article 36(1) not to own, develop, manag e or operate energy storag e facilities. 
3. Where an exem ption is grant ed under paragraph 2, the applicable tariffs, or the methodologies underlying their 
calculation, shall be reviewed and approved in accordance with Article 59(1) upon request by a user of the closed 
distr ibution system . 
4. Incidental use by a small number of households with emplo yment or similar associations with the owner of the 
distr ibution system and locat ed within the area served by a closed distr ibution system shall not preclude an exem ption 
under paragraph 2 being granted. 
Article 39 
Combined operat or 
Article 35(1) shall not prevent the operation of a combined transmission and distr ibution system operat or, provided that 
the operator complies with Article 43(1), Articles 44 and 45, or Section 3 of Chapt er VI, or that the operat or falls under

GENERAL RULES APPLICABLE TO TRANSMISSION SYSTEM OPERA TORS 
Article 40 
Tasks of transmission system operators 
1. Each transmission system operator shall be responsible for: 
(a)  ensur ing the long-t erm ability of the system to meet reasonable demands for the transmission of electr icity , 
operating, maintaining and developing under economic conditions secure, reliable and efficient transmission system 
with due regar d to the environment, in close cooperation with neighbour ing transmission system operators and 
distr ibution system operators; 
(b)  ensur ing adequate means to meet its oblig ations; 
(c)  contr ibuting to secur ity of supply through adequate transmission capacity and system reliability ; 
(d)  managing electr icity flows on the system, taking into account exchange s with other interconnect ed system s. To that 
end, the transmission system operat or shall be responsible for ensur ing a secure, reliable and efficient electr icity 
system and, in that cont ext, for ensur ing the availability of all necessar y ancillar y services, including those provid ed 
by demand response and energy storag e facilities, insof ar as such availability is independent from any other 
transmission systems with which its system is inter connected; 
(e)  provid ing to the operat or of other systems with which its system is interconnected suffi cient information to ensure 
the secure and efficient operation, coordinated development and inter operability of the inter connected system; 
(f)  ensur ing non-discr imination as between system users or classes of system users, particularly in favour of its related 
under takings; 
(g)  provid ing system users with the information they need for efficient access to the system; 
(h)  collecting cong estion rents and payments under the inter-transmission system operat or compen sation mecha nism, 
in accordance with Article 49 of Regulation (EU) 2019/943, granting and managing third-par ty access and giving 
reasoned explanations when it denies such access, whic h shall be monitor ed by the regulatory author ities; in 
carrying out their tasks under this Article transmission system operators shall primar ily facilitate mark et 
integrat ion; 
(i)  procur ing ancillar y services to ensure operational secur ity;

2. Member States may provi de that one or several responsibilities liste d in paragraph 1 of this Article be assigned to 
a transmission system operat or other than the one which owns the transmission syste m to which the responsibilities 
concer ned would other wise be applicable. The transmission syste m operat or to which the tasks are assigned shall be 
certified under the ownership unbundling, the independent system operat or or the independent transmission system 
operat or model, and fulfil the requirements provid ed for in Article 43, but shall not be required to own the transmission 
system it is responsible for. 
The transmission system operator whic h owns the transmission system shall fulfil the requirements provi ded for in 
Chapt er VI and be certified in accordance with Article 43. This shall be without prejudice to the possibility for 
transmission system operat ors whic h are certified under the ownership unbundling, the independent system operator or 
the independent transmission system operat or model to delega te, on their own initiative and under their super vision, 
certain tasks to other transmission syste m operat ors which are certified under the ownership unbundling, the 
independent syste m operat or or the independent transmission syste m operat or model where that delegation of tasks 
does not endanger the effective and independent decision-making rights of the delegating transmission syste m operat or. 14.6.2019 L 158/164 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     3. In performin g the tasks referred to in paragraph 1, transmission system operat ors shall take into account the 
recommendations issued by the regional coordination centres. 
4. In performin g the task referred to in point (i) of paragraph 1, transmission syste m operat ors shall procure 
balancing services subject to the following: 
(a)  transparent, non-discr iminato ry and mark et-based procedures; 
(b)  the participation of all qualifi ed electr icity under takings and market participants, including mark et participants 
offer ing energy from renewable sources, mark et participants engag ed in demand response, operat ors of energy 
storag e facilities and mark et participants engag ed in aggregation. 
For the purpose of point (b) of the first subparagraph, regulatory author ities and transmission syste m operators shall, in 
close cooperation with all market participants, establish technical requirements for participation in those mark ets, on the 
basis of the technical character istics of those mark ets. 
5. Paragraph 4 shall apply to the provis ion of non-frequency ancillar y services by transmission system operat ors, 
unless the regulatory author ity has assessed that the mark et-based provis ion of non-frequency ancillar y services is 
economically not efficient and has granted a deroga tion. In particular , the regulator y framework shall ensure that 
transmission syste m operators are able to procure such services from provid ers of demand response or energy storage 
and shall promot e the uptak e of energy efficiency measures, where such services cost-effe ctively alleviate the need to 
upgrade or replace electr icity capacity and suppor t the efficient and secure operation of the transmission system. 
6. Transmission system operat ors, subject to approval by the regulatory author ity, or the regulatory author ity itself, 
shall, in a transparent and participat ory process that includes all relevant syste m users and the distr ibution system 
operat ors, establish the specifi cations for the non-frequency ancillar y services procured and, where appropr iate, 
standardised mark et products for such services at least at national level. The specifi cations shall ensure the effective and 
non-discr iminato ry participation of all mark et participants, including market participants offering energy from 
renewable sources, market participants engag ed in demand response, operat ors of energy storage facilities and mark et 
participants engag ed in aggregation. Transmission syste m operat ors shall exchange all necessar y information and shall 
coordinat e with distr ibution system operators in order to ensure the optimal utilisation of resources, to ensure the 
secure and efficient operation of the syste m and to facilitate market development. Transmission system operat ors shall 
be adequate ly remunerated for the procurement of such services to allow them to reco ver at least the reasonable 
corresponding costs, including the necessar y information and communication technology expenses and infrastr ucture 
costs. 
7. The oblig ation to procure non-frequency ancillar y services refer red to in paragraph 5 does not apply to fully 
integrat ed netw ork components. 
8. Member State s or their designat ed compet ent author ities may allow transmission system operators to perform 
activities other than those provid ed for in this Directive and in Regulation (EU) 2019/943 where such activities are 
necessar y for the transmission system operat ors to fulfil their oblig ations under this Directive or Regulation 
(EU) 2019/943, provided that the regulatory author ity has assessed the necessity of such a derogation. This paragraph 
shall be without prejudice to the right of the transmission syste m operat ors to own, develop, manag e or operat e 
netw orks other than electr icity netw orks where the Member State or the designat ed compet ent author ity has granted 
such a right. 
Article 41 
Conf identiality and transparency requirements for transmission system operat ors and transmission 
system owners 
1. Without prejudice to Article 55 or another legal duty to disclose information, each transmission system operat or 
and each transmission syste m owner shall preser ve the conf identiality of commercially sensitive information obtained in 
the course of carrying out its activities, and shall prevent information about its own activities which may be 
commercially advantag eous from being disclosed in a discr iminato ry manner . In particular it shall not disclose any 
commercially sensitive information to the remaining parts of the under taking, unless such disclosure is necessar y for 
carrying out a business transaction. In order to ensure the full respect of the rules on information unbundling, Member 
States shall ensure that the transmission system owner and the remaining part of the under taking do not use joint 
services, such as joint legal services, apar t from purely administrative or IT functions. 14.6.2019 L 158/165 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     2. Transmission system operat ors shall not, in the cont ext of sales or purchases of electr icity by related under takings, 
misuse commercially sensitive information obtained from third parties in the cont ext of provi ding or negotiating access 
to the system. 
3. Information necessar y for effective competition and the efficient functioning of the mark et shall be made public. 
That oblig ation shall be without prejudice to preser ving the conf identiality of commercially sensitive information. 
Article 42 
Decision-making powers regarding the connection of new generating inst allations and energy 
storage facilities to the transmission system 
1. The transmission system operator shall establish and publish transparent and efficient procedures for non-discr imi­
natory connection of new generating installations and energy storage facilities to the transmission system. Those 
procedures shall be subject to approval by the regulatory author ities. 
2. The transmission system operator shall not be entitled to refuse the connection of a new generating installation or 
energy storag e facility on the grounds of possible future limitations to available netw ork capacities, such as cong estion 
in distant parts of the transmission syste m. The transmission syste m operat or shall supply necessar y information. 
The first subparagraph shall be without prejudice to the possibility for transmission system operators to limit the 
guarant eed connection capacity or to offer connections subject to operational limitations, in order to ensure economic 
efficiency regarding new generating installations or energy storag e facilities, provid ed that such limitations have been 
approved by the regulatory author ity. The regulatory author ity shall ensure that any limitations in guaranteed 
connection capacity or operational limitations are introduced on the basis of transparent and non-discr iminato ry 
procedures and do not create undue barriers to mark et entr y. Where the generating installation or energy storag e facility 
bears the costs related to ensur ing unlimit ed connection, no limitation shall apply . 
3. The transmission system operat or shall not be entitled to refuse a new connection point, on the ground that it 
would lead to additional costs resulting from the necessar y capacity increase of system elements in the close-up range to 
the connection point.

MANAGEMENT SAMENVATTING  
 
Om meer inzicht te krijgen in de rol die cv monteurs (kunnen) spelen in de energietransitie 
zijn er begin 2020 drie focusgroepen en telefonische interviews gehouden met in totaal 29 
cv monteurs , teamleiders en opleiders  van een installatiebedrijf . De focus  in de gesprekken 
lag op de volgende vragen : 
 
− Hoe speelt het onderwerp duurzaamheid tijdens bezoeken aan klanten? Wat voor soort 
vragen stellen klanten?  
− Hoe kijken monteurs aan tegen het geven van advies aan klanten ov er duurzaamheid of 
nieuwe technieken? Waarop baseren zij hun advies?  
− Waar liggen eventuele drempels bij het geven van advies? Wat kan monteurs helpen?  
 
De groep cv monteurs die zich heeft aangemeld voor de focusgroepen was vermoedelijk  meer dan 
hun gemiddelde collega geïnteresseerd in het onderwerp duurzaamheid.  
 
Onduidelijkheid en betaalbaarheid belangrijkste issues  voor cv monteurs  
De twee belangrijkste thema’s die de gesprekken met monteurs domineerden  waren  onduidelijkheid 
en betaalbaarheid.  
 
1. Onduidelijkheid vanuit de overheid  
Er wordt door monteurs onduidelijkheid van de overheid  ervaren over het beleid t.a .v. de 
energietransitie . Dit bleek op verschillende  manieren.   
- Waar wil de overheid naartoe ? Het is voor monteurs niet duidelijk of  ‘van het gas af’ gaat  om 
Gronings gas of al het aardgas.  
- Wanneer  is het de bedoeling dat Nederland ‘van het gas af is’? Er wordt in perceptie veel 
geschoven met jaartallen.  
- Onduidelijkheid in niveau waarop overheidsbeleid wordt bepaald en uitgevoerd. Het is voor 
monteurs lastig dat het beleid per gemeente verschilt.  
- Heeft ‘van het gas af’ een geopolitieke of duurzame motivatie ? 
- Verschillen tussen landen, bijvoorbeeld landen die aangesloten worden op het gas, leiden tot 
onduidelijkheid  
- Is de warmtepomp wel de enige en/of juiste keuze om op te focussen ? Monteurs v ragen zich af 
waarom de overheid -in perceptie - alleen  deze optie voorstelt, en waarom juist deze  optie?  
  
De gevolgen van de onduidelijkheid over het overheidsbeleid die monteurs benoemen voor 
henzelf en hun klanten : 
− Voor de monteur is het moeilijker om vragen van burgers te beantwoorden.  
− Een aanzienlijk deel van de monteurs heeft een sceptische tot zelfs negatieve houding 
tegenover het overheidsbeleid ten aanzien van de energietransitie. Velen twijfelen eraan of 
we d aadwerkelijk van het gas af gaan. Dat communiceren zij desgevraagd ook aan klanten.  
− De onduidelijkheid weerhoudt volgens monteurs burgers van het nemen van een beslissing.  
− Meerdere monteurs geven aan dat ze een aarzelende burger vanuit zichzelf adviseren om 
toch een nieuwe cv -ketel aan te schaffen.  
  
4 
 
2. Betaalbaarheid van de energietransitie  
Er waren zorgen over de betaalbaarheid van de energietransitie,  zowel voor de maatschappij als 
geheel als voor eindgebruikers . 
− Monteurs zien dat v eel klanten niet het budget hebben voor  de aanschafkosten  van een 
warmtepomp, laat staan voor de aanpassingskosten aan de woning. Bovendien zijn klanten 
meestal niet bereid zoveel geld uit te geven met een onduidelijke terugverdientijd.  
−  Subsidies zijn  in de ogen van monteurs onbekend,  veranderlijk,  ontoereiken d of lastig om 
daad werkelijk te verkrijgen .  
− Daarnaast speelt de ov erkoepelende vraag hoe betaalbaar de energietransitie is op het 
niveau van de maatschappij , en de angst dat de burger uiteindelijk degene is die voor de 
kosten opdraait . 
 
Adviesrol van cv monteurs  
Monteurs krijgen zoals al werd verwacht, veel vragen van klanten  over de energietransitie. 
Bijvoorbeeld stellen klanten de vraag: “Ik heb een ouwe ketel. Moet ik een warmtepomp 
nemen? ” Monteurs merken op dat er bij henzelf en bij klanten een gebrek aan kennis is 
over verduurzaming en energiebesparende maatregelen.  
 
Om goed advies te kunnen geven, vinden monteurs dat er te weinig kennis is :   
− Bij henzelf : er zijn teveel merken op de mark t om alles te weten en in de praktijk komen 
monteurs de warmtepomp nog niet vaak tegen.  
− In het algemeen in de markt : de markt voor warmtepompen is nog versnipperd en soms met 
geheimzinnigheid omgeven, fabrikanten geven te weinig informatie . 
− En bij het bedr ijf: men vraagt om meer kennis, in vorm van opleiding, maar ook bijv. 
filmmateriaal . 
Het hangt o.a. van de eigen interesse voor duurzaamheid, en karaktereigenschappen af of men graag 
advies geeft.  Ook tijd is een belangrijke drempel voor het geven van advi es. Service m onteurs 
hebben over het algemeen 8 klanten op een dag en dat is vaak lastig te combineren met het geven 
van goed advies over verduurzaming van de woning. De meeste monteurs vinden het ook wel 
begrijp elijk dat er niet zoveel tijd voor is  omdat h et verdienmodel  ontbreekt ; advies geven kost veel 
tijd kost maar levert  weinig op . 
In praktijk geeft men  mede vanwege het gebrek aan kennis vaak  geen advies  over de warmtepomp , 
ofwel men adviseert om toch nog een keer een nieuwe cv -ketel te nemen. M onteurs geven  verder 
vaak bespaaradviezen  voor in de woning , zoals het aanbrengen van tochtstrips of besparend gedrag.  
De algehele tendens in de  gesprekken is dat de meeste monteurs van mening zijn dat een 
adviserende rol niet moet worden verwacht van mont eurs. Dit is gebaseerd op een optelsom van de 
onduidelijkheid over de energietransitie, gecombineerd met de praktische bezwaren bij het 
adviseren (gebrek aan kennis, gebrek aan tijd, wat is het verdienmodel voor het bedrijf, etc.).  
 
Drempels die monteurs zien bij verduurzaming skeuzes van klanten  
Tijdens de focusgroepen kwamen verschillende redenen naar voren waarom klanten niet voor een 
duurzamer alternatief kiezen.   
5 
 
− Timing waarop klant over aanschaf nadenkt  is slecht:  vaak gaan klanten hierover 
nadenken  als er sprake is van een storing op het moment dat  zij in de kou zit ten. 
Dat zorgt niet voor langetermijndenken.  
− Korte - en langetermijndenken : in het algemeen vinden mensen het  lastig om 
beslissingen te nemen die op de lange termijn nut hebben, in plaats van te gaan 
voor de korte termijn.  
− Praktische nadelen van warmtepompen: bijvoorbeeld  de ruimte die wordt 
ingenomen door de apparatuur , dat er soms lawaai wordt ervaren  en de 
aanpassingen die aan de woning nodig zijn  om deze geschikt te maken voor een 
warmtepomp, zoals zeer goede isolatie.  
− Negatieve verhalen over warmtepompen door onjuist gebruik , verkeerde 
standaardinstellingen  of installatie:  monteurs wijzen erop dat een warmtepomp 
een ander stookgedrag vergt dan me nsen  gewend zijn van de cv -ketel. Dit heeft 
effect op de werking van warmtepompen en kan tot negatieve verhalen leide n. In 
het algemeen geven monteurs aan dat de installatie van warmtepompen 
ingewikkelder is en ook dat de installatie nauwer luistert voor h et goed 
functioneren ervan.  
 
Wensen van monteurs en potentiële oplossingsrichtingen die monteurs  noemen  
Hoog op de wensenlijst van monteurs staat meer duidelijkheid over het overheidsbeleid t.a.v. de 
energietransitie. Verder zien monteurs meerdere oplossingsrichtingen om de energie -transitie te 
bevorderen, deels erop gericht om hun rol als schakel richting de burger groter te kunnen maken.  
− Niet uitsluitend focussen op de warmtepomp, maar ook op andere opties zoals isoleren,  
waterzijdig inregelen,  waterstof, zonneboilers en combinatie -oplossingen .  
− Voorlichting en campagnes vanuit overheid zijn gewenst . 
− Velen verwachten dat soepeler regels en meer subsidies de oplossing zullen bieden . 
− Meer opleiding vanuit de werkgever (en mogelijk fabrikanten) is gew enst . 
− Meer tools en ondersteuning in de vorm van filmpjes , folders die monteurs mee kunnen 
geven aan hun klanten,  en ander voorlichtingsmateriaal . 
− Móchten monteurs moeten gaan adviseren, dan is meer tijd en ruimte in het dagschema 
nodig voor het geven v an advies (met bijbehorend ander verdienmodel installatiebedrij ven). 
− Monteurs die zelf met flinke korting of subsidie duurzamere apparatuur kunnen aanschaffen , 
kunnen  hun verhaal en advies richting klanten nog beter over het voetlicht brengen .

1. INLEIDING EN ACHTERGROND  
 
Om meer te leren over  de rol van cv monteurs in de energietransitie zijn door het 
Ministerie van Economische Zaken  en Klimaat  in samenwerking met een installatieb edrijf 3 
‘kennissessies’ ( focusgroepen ) georganiseerd met 26 cv monteurs , teamleiders , en 
opleiders  begin februari  2020.  Daarnaast zijn nog drie telefonische interviews uitgevoerd 
met monteurs.  
 
De verwachting vooraf was dat monteurs een belangrijke rol (kunnen) spelen in de 
transitie . Uit eerder onderzoek blijkt namelijk dat monteurs veel vragen krijgen van klanten 
over de energietransitie . Focuspunten in de gesprekken zijn:  
− Hoe speelt het onderwerp duurzaamheid tijdens bezo eken aan klanten? Wat voor soort 
vragen stellen klanten?  
− Hoe kijken  monteurs aan tegen het geven van advies aan klanten over duurzaamheid of 
nieuwe technieken? Waarop baseren zij hun advies?  
− Waar liggen eventuele drempels bij het geven van advies? Wat kan monteurs helpen?   
 
De inzichten uit de  kennissessies en de interviews  helpen om in te kaart brengen welke 
initiatieven de Rijksoverheid mogelijk zou kunnen ontwikkelen om monteurs te 
ondersteunen in de energietransitie.  
 
 
2. ACHTERGROND  MONTEURS  
Er is tijdens de focusgroep tijd besteed aan het in kaart brengen van de achtergrond van de 
monteurs.  
 
Ervaring, functie en w erkomstandigheden  
We zagen in de gesprekken  een mix tussen monteurs die al tientallen jaren als monteur 
werken bij hetzelfde bedrijf, en monteurs die korter aan het bedrijf zijn verbonden.  
Vooral oudere monteurs vertellen graag over hun jarenlange ervaring , waarin zij veel 
verschillende ontwikkelingen zagen voorbijkomen : 
− “Ik heb alles  al zien langs komen in de loop der tijd, eerst de komst van de cv -ketel, toen 
kwam de HR -ketel en nu weer de warmtepomp ”. 
 
Veel m onteurs zijn onderhouds monteur  of storingsmonteur bij particulieren : zij leggen 
dagelijks tot wel 8 bezoeken af bij kla nten. Dit zorgt voor  een vrij hoge werkdruk en geeft 
de monteur in perceptie bijna altijd (te) weinig tijd om te spenderen bij iedere  klant.  
−  “Als mensen vragen: ik h eb een ouwe ketel. Moet ik een warmtepomp? Ik kijk dan als 
monteur op mijn bonnen. Ik kan zo anderhalf uur praten met zo’n klant, ik voel dan de 
werkdruk .” 
 
Sommige monteurs werken  aan grotere installatie projecten , o.a. bij zakelijke klanten, zoals 
woningbouwcorporaties . Meerdere deelnemers zijn teamleider , en/of houden zich (een 
deel van hun tijd) bezig met het opleiden van jongere monteurs.

Geïnteresseerden in het onderwerp  energietransitie  
De oproep over een kennissessie over dit thema heeft geresulteerd in een groep van  in dit 
onderwerp geïnteresseerde mensen  (dit werd vooraf al verwacht) . In alle drie de groepen 
zaten wel 1 of meer  monteurs die erg bevlogen zijn over dit onderwerp. Sommige n maken 
er een sport van om zelf zo duurzaam mogelijk bezig te zijn. Verschillende  monteurs 
hebben in hun thuissituatie extra duurzame constructies staan of experimenteren hiermee.  
Zij vertellen hier ook wel eens over aan hun klanten.  
− “Ik ben altijd ge ïnteresseerd  geweest  in nieuwe technieken. Interesse was er altijd al, vanuit 
huis uit meegekregen. ” 
− “Ik kan het zelf installeren, zit dicht bij het vuur. Ik heb een warmtepompboiler thuis 
neergehangen, gewoon om te kijken hoe gaat dat, hoe functioneert dat , hoe gaat het met 
geluid, gewoon proefondervindelijk. ” 
−  “Ik ben al  10 jaar bezig met warmtepompen. Het l aatste jaar met mijn eigen huurwoning 
bezig om te kijken wat ik zelf kan doen, onafhankelijk van verhuurder. Nu voor elkaar 
gekregen dat ik zonnepanelen heb. Ik heb een behoorlijk overschot,  ben daarom met boiler 
bezig  (…) H eb het gas 1/3 naar beneden gekregen. Ik kan alles zelf doen , maar dit zou voor 
gemiddelde part iculier 12 -14000 Euro kosten. Ik ben aan het kijken naar een elektrische 
boiler. Die ga ik in Duitsland kopen, is daar een stuk goedkoper. “ 
 
De monteurs koppelen terug dat ze zelf inschatten dat zij vergeleken  met hun collega’s 
relatief veel affiniteit hebben met dit onderwerp.  
− “Ik denk dat ik een van de weinigen ben die zo enthousiast is. Veel van mijn collega’s zijn niet 
zo positief. Op feestjes kunnen ze uren over een badkamer praten, maar verwarmen vinden 
mense n niet leuk. Maar als je het goede verhaal vertelt , worden mensen enthousiast ”. 
- “De meesten boeit het niet. Die mensen gaan ook niet aan hun klanten uitleggen hoe ze hun installatie 
af moeten stellen of hoe ze moeten isoleren ”. 
−  “Ik ben een milieufreak. Ik zeg dan: ze doen dit niet voor niets. Je ziet dat er dingen 
veranderen en het is niet goed om zo veel uit de grond te halen als er een andere manier is. 
Als er veel collega’s sceptisch zijn , is het wel overleven in zo ’n sfeer ”.

3. DE TWEE BELANGRIJKSTE DREMPELS  VOOR  MONT EURS IN DE  
ENERGIE TRANSITIE  
 
Er spelen  twee grote thema ’s die volgens monteurs een drempel zijn  in de energietransitie : 1.) De 
onduidelijkheid van de overheid over het beleid en 2.) Geld en betaalbaarheid . Deze kwamen in alle 
gesprekken  prominent  naar voren:  
 
Onduidelijkheid van de overheid over het beleid t.a.v. de energietransitie   
Volgens monteurs zijn het standpunt en het beleid van de overheid over het thema energietransitie 
onduidelijk. De belangrijkste vragen die onder monteurs, en volgens hen ook onder burgers,  leven 
zijn: 
 
In zijn algemeenheid: waar wil de overheid naartoe en wanneer ? De overheid predikt in perceptie: 
‘We gaan van het gas af’. Maar het is voor monteurs niet duidelijk wat dit betekent. Men weet niet 
zeker of het nu om Gronings gas of al het aardgas gaa t. Daarbij vraagt men zich af: wordt het een 
verplichting om van het gas af te gaan? En zo ja, wordt er dan ook gehandhaafd  (NB: sommige  
monteurs verwachten dat er geen handhaving zal zijn , hoewel de overheid in theorie niet hoeft te 
handhaven als er geen gas meer uit de leiding zou komen ).  
 
1. Is de energietransitie een feit?  
Er heerst  twijfel of de energietransitie  daadwerkelijk gaat gebeuren en men twijfel t eraan  of deze  
überhaupt mogelijk is.  Er zijn bij de monteurs ook twijfels over de praktische haalbaarheid van deze 
overgang. Ze brengen bijvoorbeeld de vraag ter sprake of de  infrastructuur, i.c. de e lectriciteitsnetten 
het wel aankunnen.  
− “De overheid wil van het gas af, dan moet je van tevoren ook weten hoe je dat moet doen. 
Want een k lant krijgt op het nieuws te horen we gaan in 2040 van het gas af. Oh, ja, dan 
moet ik een peperduur apparaat gaan kopen. (…) Dit geeft heel veel onrust en onzekerheid, 
bij de klant maar ook in de installatiebranche .” 
− “Het zou fijn zijn als er een helder en duidelijk beleid was , dat ook gevolgd wordt zonder 
allerlei partij politieke doelstellingen of belangen. Op een gegeven moment komen er weer 
verkiezingen en dan is alles mooi, en dan komt er een nieuw kabinet en dan wordt het toch 
weer bijgesteld .” 
− “Er wordt eerst geroepen en dan pas nagedacht door de overheid. Een voorbeeld zijn de 
warmtepompen. Er zijn te veel warmtepompen op de markt en overal zit subsidie op. 
Daald erop is de enige waarbij je geen koelvloeistof in de grond hoeft te doen. Maar d an is er 
geen marktwerking meer. Maar door alle keuze weten mensen het niet meer dan kiezen ze 
weer een ketel ” 
− “Van het ‘gas’ af…? We gaan van het Gronings aardgas af. Dat is heel wat anders ”. 
−  “Ik moest een keer een ketel maken bij een man die in Den Haag werkte. (…) Die man gaf 
aan: tot 2050 kan je makkelijk nog ketels plaatsen. Dat heb ik gedeeld met al mijn collega’s ”. 
− “Ik denk dat heel NL van het aardgas afgaat, dat kan helemaal niet. Daar is onze infra niet 
toereikend voor denk ik. Als je een hele straat vol legt met zonnepanelen, en de zon schijnt, 
en je wilt allemaal terugleveren aan het net, dan blijkt dat de capaciteit van het net niet 
voldoende is. ” 
  
9 
 
2. Wanneer  is het de bedoeling dat Nederland ‘van het gas af ’ is?  
Er wordt in perceptie veel geschoven met jaartallen . 
− “Als er iets op het nieuws is krijg je veel vragen. Bijvoorbeeld 2 jaar geleden werd er verteld 
dat er vanaf 2021 geen ketels meer mochten worden verkocht. Toen kreeg ik heel veel 
vragen, want wat het nieuws zegt , dat klopt zeg maar. Dan ben je zeker een kwartier of een 
half uur aan het vertellen: dat loopt zo’n vaart niet. Koop in ieder geval een nieuwe ketel.”  
− “Die zakelijke opdrachtgevers hebben drie data in hun hoofd; 2020 , 2030  en 2050. 2030 lijkt 
nog heel ver weg. Is heel dichtbij. Die denken dat duurt nog een paar kabinetten, misschien 
is het beleid dan wel helemaal bijgedraaid. We zorgen eerst in 2020 dat we gemiddeld op 
label B zitten …” 
− “Hier is nog steeds onduidelijk wat er gaat gebeuren. Nu zeggen ze weer tot 2030 wordt het 
afgebouwd .” 
 
3. De gemeente of het Rijk?  
Bijkomend element in de onduidelijkheid van de overheid, is het niveau waarop 
overheidsbeleid wordt bepaald en uitgevoerd. Het is voor monteurs lastig dat het beleid 
per gemeente verschilt. Er worden door monteurs verschillende  voorbeelden aangehaald 
van onduidelijke situaties  die voor verwarring zorgen : 
 
− “De plannen van de gemeente, daar zitten we op te wachten. Die zijn nog niet voor iedereen 
duidelijk. De gemeenten hebben veel  [onderling]  verschil en de plannen zien er per 
gemeente heel anders uit, ande re teksten. Dat moet eigenlijk gewoon samenwerken. Dat is 
lastig. ” 
− “Met name bij gemeenten, wat ze van plan zijn. We roepen altijd bij klanten wacht op 
gebiedsindelingen , ga dan pas je beslissing nemen.”  
− “Bij z onne -energie bijvoorbeeld. Dat is per gemeente verschillend. Dat is ook moeilijk. ” 
 
4. Duurzame of geopolitieke motivatie?   
Dit betreft de vraag : heeft  het overheidsbeleid  vooral  een duurzame motivatie,  of is het een 
beslissing  die is ingegeven door geopolitieke motieven?  Omdat de werkelijke motivatie van het 
beleid niet helder is, ontstaat extra twijfel over het al dan niet meegaan in de omschakel ing naar een 
andere energiebron dan (aard)gas.  
− “Je kan op basis van je kennis en kunde een verhaal vertellen, maar je weet zelf niet 
helemaal of het klopt. De Nederlandse Aardoliemaatschappij heeft aandelen gekocht in 
Russisch gas. Waarom hebben ze dat gedaan? We gaan van het gas af, maar investeren er 
ook in. Dat is raar. Al s we op het Russisch gas gaan , waarom moeten we dan allemaal een 
warmtepomp?”  
− “Ik denk dat heel veel mensen het gevoel hebben dat die energietransitie puur te maken 
heeft met we draaien Groningen dicht , we willen niet afhankelijk zijn van meneer Poetin in 
Rusland. Financieel gedreven. We hoeven helemaal niet van het gas af, er is gas genoeg in 
de wereld. Maar we willen ( of moeten) onze begroting spekken. Dat is  wat bij veel mensen 
speelt. Bijna bij iedere klant hoor je dat .” 
  
10 
 
5. Verschillen tussen Europese landen  
Het energ iebeleid is in andere Europese landen anders. In sommige landen  wordt aard gas 
juist als een duurzame energievorm gezien en gestimuleerd.  Dat roept zowel bij de 
monteurs zelf als bij klanten ook weer vragen op . 
−  “Als Duitse bewoners op gas overgaan  krijgen ze een subsidie van 6000 euro. Dit is een 
verhaal in de media. Het vertrouwen in de overheid is weg. Als dit zo doorgaat doet niemand 
het meer .” 
− “Ik heb wel eens d iscussie met klanten: waarom moeten we van het gas af , als Italie en 
Duitsland juist op het gas gaan? Ja , mijn antwoord zeg ik , dat is een politiek spel. Wat wij 
doen maakt op het grote geheel ook niet uit. We krijgen ook uitstoot van de buren binnen. ” 
 
6. Twijfel over de focus op de warmtepomp  
Hierbij gaat het om  de vraag of de warmtepomp wel de enige en/of juiste keuze is om op te 
focussen. Monteurs vragen zich af w aarom de overheid -in perceptie - alleen  deze optie 
voor stelt , en waarom juist deze  optie? Er zijn toch veel meer opties, waarin ook geloof 
heerst  onder sommige monteurs , zoals  waterstof . 
− “Wie zegt dat we allemaal een warmtepomp moeten? De media zeggen dat. Er komt een 
transitie dus we moeten wat. Wat is een transitie? Geen fossiele brandstoffen ... Mínder 
fossiele brandstoffen .... Maar een ‘wkk’ is ook transitie. (NB= Warmte -krachtkoppelin g). 
Waterstofketeltje is ook transitie. En zonnepanelen .” 
− “Volgens mij is waterstof de oplossing. Ze zijn in mijn buurt een waterstofmolen aan het 
bouwen. ”  
− ”Er is ook al veel te winnen door je gedrag aan te passen, door anders te stoken. Ik adviseer 
bij een combi -ketel een zonneboiler. Dat scheelt toch al aanzienlijk in gas. Ik heb het zelf  
gedaan en ik krijg geld terug .” 
− “Wat gaat er gebeuren in de toekomst? Electrische tegels? Waterstof? Warmtepomp?  
Ik wacht nog wel even …” 
− “Je moet o pties geven: een warmtepomp is één ding. Er zijn nog meer dingen mogelijk. Die 
ook vertellen aan de klant.”  
− “Waterstof is een goed alternatief. Ze kunnen al 10% waterstof bij het aardgas gooien. Dat 
wordt door de grote bedrijven zoals Shell tegengehouden. ” 
 
 
 
 
 
 De gevolgen van de onduidelijkheid  over het overheidsbeleid zijn:  
* Voor de monteur is het niet prettig dat hij o.a. vanwege de onduidelijkheid vragen van burgers niet kan beantwoorden. Over 
vragen en advies: meer in hoofdstuk 4 - Monteurs en de adviesrol.  
* Een aanzienlijk deel van de monteurs heeft een sceptische houding tegenover het overheidsb eleid ten aanzien van de 
energietransitie, tot zelfs een negatieve houding . Velen twijfelen eraan of we daadwerkelijk van het gas af gaan. Dat 
communiceren zij desgevraagd ook aan klanten. De onduidelijkheid weerhoudt volgens monteurs burgers van het nemen  van 
een beslissing.  
* Meerdere monteurs geven aan dat ze een aarzelende burger vanuit zichzelf adviseren om toch een nieuwe cv -ketel aan te 
schaffen. Hierover ook meer in Hoofdstuk 4.  
  
11 
 
Geld en betaalbaarheid  
Een volgens monteurs nagenoeg even groot issue als de onduidelijkheid over het overheidsbeleid , is 
het financiële thema: hoe zit het met de betaalbaarheid  van de transitie naar duurzame energie ?  
De vraag over de betaalbaarheid speelt  op alle niveaus : van de portemonee van een individuele 
burger , tot en met de totale betaalbaarheid  van de energi etransitie  voor de maatschappij.  
Het thema  Geld en betaalbaarheid valt uiteen in drie onderdelen : kosten voor de gebruiker, subsidies 
en betaalbaarheid voor de maatschappij in het geheel.  
 
1. Kosten voor de  gebruiker  
Monteurs geven aan dat klanten wel iswaar vaak  vragen  naar  een warmtepomp , maar als de monteur 
dan het kostenplaatje schetst: 8000 euro voor de pomp en dat is nog zonder isoleren, dan verbleken 
klanten. Veel klanten hebben helemaal het budget niet om de aanschafkosten te dragen. Andere 
klante n hebben wellicht wel het budget  beschikbaar , maar geven dit veel liever uit aan andere zaken 
dan aan duurzame energie. Daarbij komt nog dat niet altijd duidelijk is hoe snel je de aanschafkosten  
kunt terug verdienen, zeker als het beleid van de overheid (in perceptie) zwalkt.  Dit brengt nog meer 
onzekerheid.  
− “Heel veel mensen hebben geen schuin dak. Mijn schoonouders wilden zonnepanelen, maar 
iedereen raadt het af. De installatie is te duur omdat er te weinig zonnepanelen op kunnen, 
dan is het niet rendabel.”  
− “Wat we ook wel eens horen is dat mensen bang zijn dat de overheid of 
energiemaatschappijen hen gaan oplichten. Bijvoorbeeld met de salderingsregeling, dan 
neem je zonnepanelen , maar moet je meer belasting gaan betalen of kan je het niet meer 
gunstig verkopen.  Ze zijn bang dat  een gunstige optie niet gunstig blijft. Dat gaat ook best 
diep bij mensen thuis. Als je geen vertrouwen hebt is dat best lastig. Met alle duurzame 
opties merk ik dat.”  
− “Mensen vragen zich af wat het oplevert en de terugverdientijd is erg lang. Wat kost he t 
vragen ze. “ 
Er wordt in alle groepen voorbeelden geschetst van  de hoge aanschafkosten van de warmtepomp die 
vele malen hoger  liggen dan de kosten voor een cv -ketel . En nog substantiëler: daar komen ook nog 
hoge  kosten bij om de woning aan te passen  om deze geschikt te maken . Monteurs vertellen over 
hun ervaringen bij klanten die op voorhand welwillend zijn  om een warmtepomp te overwegen , 
maar in praktijk afhaken op het prijskaartje.  
− “Het draait om geld. De bewon ers willen wel graag verduurzamen, maar dan komt het 
kostenplaatje en wie gaat het uiteindelijk betalen. Als ze een keuze moeten maken tussen 
een warmtepomp van 8000 euro of een keteltje van 1500 euro, dan is die keuze snel 
gemaakt. ” 
− “Een goed hybride syst eem (hybride warmtepomp) kost 8000 euro, mensen denken dat het 
1500 euro kost. Mensen verschieten daarvan. ” 
− “Heel veel klanten willen een warmtepomp, maar ze schrikken al terug als ze een beetje een 
richtprijs krijgen. Ze weten niet wat ze moeten, ze wille n wel, want ze willen van het gas af , 
totdat ze de kosten horen.”  
 
  
12 
 
 
− “Mensen vragen ook naar isoleren, dan wordt er snel gekeken naar de prijs. Een woning 
klaar maken voor warmtepomp kost heel veel geld, dat hebben veel mensen niet. Geld is het 
allerbelangrijkste. ” 
− “Het is niet alleen die kosten, maar ook isolatie, je ramen. Je hele installatie, systeem moet 
aangepast worden. ” 
 
2. Subsidies  zijn onbekend of lastig  om werkelijk te verkrijgen  
Tijdens de kennissessies komen subsidies veelvuldig ter sprake . Er is volgens monteurs  te weinig 
subsidiegeld beschi kbaar . Ook bestaat er onduidelijkheid over welke subsidies  er zijn  en in welke 
gevallen deze aangevraagd kunnen worden . Het aanvragen van subsidies  werkt  in praktijk niet altijd 
mak kelijk  geven monteurs aan. D e timing van het uitvoeren en de keuze van het soort 
werkzaamheden  luistert  erg nauw. Ook geven monteurs aan dat zij het onvoorspelbaar vinden 
wanneer  subsidies op zijn of aangepast worden . 
 
− “Ik heb zelf vloerverwarming met isolatie, en heb een nieuw dak geplaatst met 
unidekpanelen. Nul subsidie. Maar als ik wat isolatieplaten tegen mijn dak sla, dan krijg ik 
wel subsidie. Dat hebben ze vorige zomer pas aangepast. Dan denk ik , ze snappen het niet. 
Bij mij zat het er toen al in. Dat vond ik wel een dingetje. ” 
− “Er zijn wel subsidies, maar die zijn beperkt. Nieuwbouw  [woning]  is niet te krijgen.”  
− “Sommigen hebben een spaarpot en anderen niet. Sommigen zeggen: als ik zou kunnen 
besparen, vind ik dat wel leuk. Als je die verwijst naar subsidies en overheidswebsites, 
moeten ze inloggen met hun Digid, dan moet er een adviseur heen. Dat kost moeite.”  
− “Dan vraag je subsidie aan, 1250 euro  (…) dan krijg je bericht , de termijn is verlengd met  
8 weken . Ik weet nu al dat ik niet s krijg , want de pot was eind nov ember  leeg. (…) Dan mag 
je het in jan uari opnieuw indienen, maar is de subsidie van 1250 nu 500 euro geworden. Dat 
kan voor heel veel mensen net de trigger zijn om het toch niet te doen. “ 
− “Als je zegt wat het kost en wat het bespaart , zie je dat de subsidies te laag zijn. Voor zonne -energie 
bijvoorbeeld. En het is per gemeente verschillend. Dat is ook moeilijk. ” 
 
Monteurs zien  overigens  juist  in de richting van  het subsidiebeleid  wel potentiële oplossingen voor 
de overgang naar duurzame energie. Zie hierover meer in hoofdstuk 6 Oplossingsrichtingen die 
monteurs aandragen . 
 
3. Hoe betaalbaar (en haalbaar)  is de energietransitie  op het niveau van de maatschappij ? 
Gekoppeld aan de sceptische houding die sommige monteurs hebben, klinkt in de kennissessies het 
geloof door dat het uiteindelijk altijd de burger is die het prijskaartje voor duurzame energie betaalt, 
hoe het beleid ook wordt ingericht.  
− “Het gevaar bij financieel aantrekkelijk maken is dat ik het uiteindelijk toch zelf moet 
betalen .” 
− “Als we minder gas gaan gebruiken, gaat de belasting op gas omhoog. Per saldo ga je niet 
minder betalen. Uiteindelijk moet het ergens vandaan komen . Als burger zou je vanuit de 
overheid een garantie  moeten hebben : als ik ga besparen op gas, ga ik daadwerkelijk minder 
betalen. ”  
13 
 
 
 
4. MONTEURS EN DE ADVIESROL : KENNIS, HOUDING EN GEDRAG  
Er werd tijdens de focusgroepen gesproken over de vragen die klanten stellen, hoe 
monteurs aankijken  tegen het geven van advies aan klanten over duurzaamheid of nieuwe 
technieken  en waarop monteurs hun advies baseren. Ook werd besproken w aar eventuele 
drem pels liggen  bij het geven van advies . Tot slot werd besproken wat monteurs hierin kan 
helpen .  
 
Vragen van klanten over de energietransitie  
Monteurs koppelen terug dat ze inderdaad vaak door burgers worden aangesproken over het 
onderwerp ‘Nederland moet v an het gas af’. Veelal komt in zo’n gesprek de onduidelijkheid van het 
overheidsbeleid ter sprake (en dan wordt er gepraat over dezelfde thema’s die zijn genoemd in 
Hoofdstuk 3). Burgers stellen aan de monteur de vraag wat voor hen verstandig is om te doen  in het 
kader van ‘van het gas af gaan’. Monteurs moeten hierop een duidelijk antwoord schuldig blijven, 
omdat ze het zelf ook niet weten .  
 
1. Vragen van klanten  
De vragen die klanten stellen aan monteurs lopen zeer uiteen:  
­ Ik heb een ou de ketel. Moet ik een warmtepomp nemen?  
­ Wat kan ik het beste doen als de ketel vervangen moet worden?  
­ Is het wel verstandig om een ketel te kopen, want kan ik hem wel zo lang 
blijven gebruiken?  
­ Hoe lang duurt het voor ik de aanschaf van een warmtepomp heb terug 
verdiend?  
­ Kan ik van de geiser af voor het warm water?  
­ Hoe kan ik verduurzamen, wat is de volgende stap in mijn woning?  
­ Mag de warmte  unit van de pomp buiten staan?  
­ Is mijn huis wel geschikt voor een warmtepomp?  
­ Wat is biomassa?  
­ Wat gaat er gebeuren als de  kolencentrales dicht gaan?  
­ Kan ik ook alleen met zonnepanelen duurzaam stoken?  
­ Wat zou een alternatief zijn voor de warmtepomp?  
­ Hoeveel subsidie kan ik krijgen voor een warmtepomp?  
­ Welke radiator moet ik nemen voor een warmtepomp?  
 
2. De monteur als bron van kennis  
Meerdere m onteurs geven spontaan aan dat zij zichzelf als een belangrijke bron zien voor 
burgers om advies van te krijgen . Daarmee versterken ze de gedachte die het Behavioural 
Insights Team van het Ministerie van Economische zaken  en Klimaat  heeft dat cv monteurs 
een belangrijke schakel kunnen zijn bij de energietransitie.  
− “Mensen geloven je als monteur eerder dan mensen van buiten.”  
− “Mensen verzuipen in alle informatie, als ze gaan zoeken verzuipen ze in de informatie en 
klikken ze het weg en  denken, ik wacht wel tot de monteur komt .” 
− “Wij staan als verwarmingsmonteurs voor aan de linie”   
14 
 
 
Monteurs nemen waar dat er bij klanten veel gebrek aan  kennis is over dit onderwerp . Er is 
weinig kennis op meerdere terreinen:  
 
­ Er is bij klanten een g ebrek aan kennis o ver de volgorde van verduurzaming, 
bijvoorbeeld dat je een woning eerst moet isoleren  voordat een woning geschikt is voor 
technieken zoals een warmtepomp.  
­ Klanten weten over het algemeen weinig over andere energiebesparende maatregelen 
zoals bijvoorbeeld het inregelen  van de cv- ketel . 
­ Er is bij klanten met een warmtepomp een g ebrek aan ke nnis o ver h oe de 
warmtepomp juist te gebruiken, en dat het anders werkt dan een cv- ketel. Het is 
bijvoorbeeld belangrijk dat de pomp niet steeds aan - en uit word t gezet, omdat dit  
consequenties heeft voor werking van apparaat.  Dit leidt tot fout gebruik v an de 
warmtepomp in de praktijk, slechte verhalen over de warmtepomp en een kortere 
levensduur van de apparaten.  
­ Er is in het algemeen weinig besef bij klanten over h et belang van een constante 
verwarming voor zuinigheid.  
 
De adviesrol: Kennis, houding en gedrag van monteurs  
Wat monteurs terugkoppelen over het geven van advies , kan worden gestructureerd in drie 
elementen: kennis, houding en gedrag . Deze drie elementen worden hierna uitgebreider toegelicht 
en geïllustreerd met citaten.  
 
1 KENNIS  2 HOUDING  3 GEDRAG  
 
Er is sprake van  te weinig 
kennis volgens monteurs :  
- In het algemeen in de 
markt  
- Bij henzelf  
- En bij het bedrijf  
 
  
Grondhouding t.a.v adviseren 
hangt af van:  
- Eigen interesse/passie  voor 
duurzaamheid  
- Opleidingsniveau en functie  
- Of men o pen staat voor andere 
werkzaamheden dan waar 
men primair voor is opgeleid .  
In praktijk geeft men veelal : 
- Ofwel geen advies  
- Of adviseert men toch nog 
een keer een nieuwe cv - 
ketel te nemen  
 
Men doet wel meer aan 
bespaar adviezen, zoals 
tochtstrips , besparend 
gedrag , of de aanschaf van 
een zuinigere cv -ketel.  
 
 
 
1. Te weinig kennis om goed te kunnen adviseren  
In praktijk is het geven van advies lastig, omdat veel monteurs vinden dat ze te weinig kennis hebben 
over de energietransitie  en de apparatuur die men in perceptie  wordt geacht te adviseren  (namelijk 
warmtepompen) . Het gebrek aan kennis heeft te maken met  verschillende zaken. Deze worden 
hieronder weergegeven.  
Op de hoogte  van overheidsplannin g 
De onduidelijkheid die monteurs ervaren vanuit de overhei d (zie ook Hoofdstuk 3). Hoe kun je 
adviseren als je niet weet hoe het zit en waar het naartoe gaat?  
− “Ik hoef ook niet uit te kunnen leggen hoe het apparaat gerepareerd moet worden, maar ik 
wil wel een duidelijk verhaal kunnen vertellen. Ik vertel wat ik in de wandelgangen hoor. De  
15 
 
ontwikkelingen staan niet stil. Er zijn veel meer mogelijkheden als we er serieus op ingaan, 
en een serieuze cursus te volgen, om naar de klant zelf een duidelijk verhaal te vertellen. En 
dan nog moet je met de klant om de tafel gaan zitten om te bespreken wat het beste bij ze 
past. Als er geen duidelijk verhaal is, gaat geen mens overstag.”  
− “We zitten ook in een onzekere periode. We weten niet waar we naartoe gaan met z’n allen. 
Ik ben soms bij de technische uni e, als er iets is schrijf ik me ervoor in. Op de uni e laten ze 
nieuwe technieken  zien. Je hebt het wel al allemaal, maar het is of duur of een prototype. 
Dus we weten nog niet wat het word t, dus ik weet niet wat ik moet adviseren. ” 
− “Ik vind het b elangrijk om het ‘eerlijke verhaal’ te kunnen vertellen aan klanten. Maar w at is 
het eerlijke verhaal? ” 
De onzekerheid van n ieuw e techniek  
Het relatief nieuw zijn van apparatuur zoals de warmtepomp (zie ook paragraaf 5.4). In een nieuwe 
markt bestaan altijd v eel meer onzekerheden  dan in een gevestigde markt , bijvoorbeeld over 
gebruik, ser vice, et cetera.  
− “Mensen willen heel veel zekerheid. Ik kom veel in Zeeland, dan rijd je in the middl e of 
nowhere en dan is er iets kapot. Als het een warmtepomp is dan weten veel monteurs niet 
wat ze moeten doen. ” 
− “Wat lastig is: v ertel je wel de waarheid? Klopt het wel wat je zegt. Je moet eigenlijk iets adviseren 
waarvan je niet eens weet hoe het zit. Je houdt mensen dan iets lekkers voor en later haal je het weer 
weg.  
 
Grote variatie in aanbod  warmtepompen  
Het grote aantal warmtepompen op de markt en de soms gebrekkige ondersteuning van fabrikanten  
is heel anders dan bij cv -ketels. Doordat er zo veel verschillende w armte pompen zijn, zijn er  geen 
warmtepompen  die monteur s vaak genoeg zien om ze goed te leren kennen . Daarbij is  het 
installeren van een warmtepomp technisch veel ingewikkelder en de installatie ligt gevoeliger dan bij 
een cv-ketel . De juiste werking hangt meer af van de juiste wer kwijze van de monteur. Ook de 
aansluiting van cv op hy bride is ingewikkeld.  
  
De klant als expert  
Klanten die al geïnteresseerd  zijn in een duurzame energie oplossing, hebben soms  meer kennis dan 
de monteur.  Dat maakt het geven van advies extra lastig.  
− “Een andere drempel is dat veel mensen info kunnen opzoeken op Google en daarom weten ze 
meer over de warmtepomp dan de monteur. De kla nt vraagt om advies maar weet het in die 
gevallen beter dan ik. Dat is moeilijk. Ze hebben al offertes opgevraagd en hebben veel 
informatie opgevraagd. Ik kan dan niet goed adviseren, want ik weet niet zo veel over 
warmtepompen. Ik heb de tijd niet om dat uit te zoeken.”  
− “Klanten hebben een verwachting. Kijk wij onderhouden en repareren ketels en 
warmtepompen enz. Wat je steeds meer ziet is dat monteurs bestookt worden met vragen als 
een adviseur. Ze stellen vragen, we leiden monteurs  daar helemaal niet in op, dat is ook 
helemaal de vraag niet. Ze gaan erheen om een ketel te onderhouden , niet voor advies. ”  
 
2. Houding  t.a.v. advis eren  
Of monteurs  al dan niet advies willen geven wordt door meerdere factoren beïnvloed .  
16 
 
Duurzaamheid  
De eigen houding ten opzichte van duurzaamheid  speelt een rol in de bereidheid de klant hierover te 
adviseren. D e paar monteurs die echt gepassioneerd zijn hierover advis eren graag, ook buiten hun 
werk om en lopen hiervoor extra hard, zo lijkt het.  
− “Ik vind het leuk, ik trek soms de tijd uit om uit te leggen wat mogelijk is. Dan komt de 
vraag , bieden jullie dat ook aan en dan zeg ik zo ver is het nog niet. Ik zit krap in de tijd maar 
ik wil het toch graag doen. ”’ 
­ “Ik word alleen maar enthousiaster en ik gebruik mijn kennis en ervaring. De tijd wordt alleen maar 
leuker voor de techneuten die het  leuk vinden. Als ze zeggen dat het niet kan werken het toch 
werkbaar maken. Dat is hoe ik wil werken. Als mensen zeggen dat het niet kan ga ik een oplossing 
zoeken” . 
 
Openstaan voor aanvullende werkzaamheden  
In hoeverre men als persoon open staat voor andere werkzaamheden dan waar men primair voor is 
opgeleid . 
− “Als mensen lang in dienst zijn en niks anders gewend zijn is het lastig om de switch te 
maken. Die willen alleen maar ketels, zelfs mechanische ventilatie is al te gek. Ze willen van 
8 tot 4  werken en dan naar huis ”. 
− “Sommige collega’s luisteren niet als ik iets vertel. De m entaliteit verandert. Jongere heeft  
soms  8 tot 5 mentaliteit, het interesseert ze niet. Warmtepompen kosten meer tijd .” 
− “Ik vind het heel leuk om te adviseren. […]. Ik praat graag met mensen. Ik denk 
ondernemend en ik  hou van problemen oplossen. Met mensen praten vind ik het mooiste 
van het vak. Als ik vol passie kan uitleggen doe ik dat graag.”  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. Gedrag : hoe adviseren monteurs?  
Monteurs geven aan dat zij w einig tijd beschikbaar  hebben , vaak een cv-ketel adviseren en tijdens 
het werk bij klanten  wel bespaartips  gegeven . 
Te weinig tijd  
In perceptie is er altijd te weinig tijd voor gesprekken met de klant (over welk onderwerp dan ook, 
dus ook over duurzaamheid). Maar juist het geven van een goed advies over duurzame oplossingen 
kost heel veel tijd, zo is de ervaring van monteurs. Tijd die zij niet hebben.  Ook verschilt de 
mogelijkheid tot het geven van advies per functie. E en storingsmonteur die 8 klanten op een dag 
afwerkt , heeft een andere uitgangssituatie  en mogelijkheden dan iemand die speciaal is belast met 
het opleiden van monteurs en het thema duurzaamheid . De algehele tendens over alle gesprekken heen, is dat (op enkele zeer gepassioneerde personen na) 
de meeste monteurs op he t standpunt staan dat een adviserende rol niet moet worden verwacht van 
monteurs . Dit is gebaseerd op een optelsom van de onduidelijkheid over de energietransitie, 
gecombineerd met de praktische bezwaren bij het adviseren (gebrek aan kennis, gebrek aan tij d, wat 
is het verdienmodel voor het bedrijf, etc .).  
De personen die positiever staan tegenover een adviserende rol van monteurs, geven daarbij wel aan 
dat er veel zou moeten veranderen voor  het echt zo ver kan zijn: zowel wat betreft het kennisniveau  
van personeel, als de beschikbare tijd die men krijgt bij een klant.   
17 
 
− “In een uur kan je niet de klant uitleggen wat de goede volgorde is, hoe de wereld in elkaar 
zit. Klant komt met heel veel vragen, die heeft heel veel gehoord. Die denkt ik wil een 
warmtepomp, dan moet jij uitleggen aan welke voorwaarden ze moeten voldoen. 
Stookgedrag, isoleren. Je moet bij A beginnen met uitleggen, koelkast is ook een 
warmtepomp die krijgt je bier wel koud maar die heeft wel een dagje nodig. Het is niet zoals 
we gewend zijn bij een ketel, die kost 1800 euro, een half uur maak je er een prijs aan vast, 
offerte en dan heb je een keteltje verkocht. Er komt een heel verhaal bij”  
− “Ik ben servicemonteur. Ik kan niet overal lange verhalen vertellen.”  
Ook het verdienmode l voor het installatiebedrijf speelt een rol. Meerdere deelnemers 
refereren aan de bedrijfsvoering van het installatiebedrijf: het is voor het verdienmodel 
onverstandig als er veel tijd wordt gespendeerd aan advies terwijl je niets verkoopt.  
 
− “We hebben wel een bedrijf te voeren, daar horen inkomsten en salarissen bij. We vinden 
het heel leuk om mensen te adviseren, maar we houden er geen droog brood aan over op dit 
moment. Dat maakt het lastig als onderneming .” 
 
Cv- ketel het advies voor de komende jaren  
In de gesprekken word t er meermaals verteld dat in praktijk het advies vanuit monteurs toch is om 
nog niet op de warmtepomp over te gaan, maar dat een cv -ketel nog steeds de meest verstandige 
oplossing is voor de komende jaren.  
−  “Eigenlijk is het standaard advies - ik durf het bijna  niet te zeggen - neem maar een cv -ketel, 
en dat is het eerlijke verhaal. En dat doorverwijzen naar adviseurs, kost teveel en teveel tijd, 
er is te weinig kennis bij adviseurs .” 
− “Mijn antwoord is altijd oppervlakkig, ik ga niet echt diep. Ik zeg altijd dat ik niet geloof dat 
we op korte termijn van  het gas af gaan. Ik reken  voor dat een cv-ketel de beste oplossing  
is.” 
− “Probeer maar eens uit te leggen aan een particuliere klant bijv. dat hij de keuze heeft 
tussen een keteltje van 1800 Euro en dan hoeft hij verder niks te doen en krijgt hij goed 
warm water of een investering van 10 -15000 euro, misschien wel 30 -40. Dan is de keuze niet 
zo moeilijk .” 
− “Ook in de kennissenkring, heb bij een nichtje een nieuwe ketel opgehangen. Moet ik een 
warmtepomp nemen? Neem nou maar een keteltje dan ben je voorlopig even klaar. Dan 
moet je gaan isoleren. Ze had ook niet zoveel te besteden, het is een lastig . Wat adviseer 
je…” 
− “Als monteur zie ik het niet zo snel gebeuren dat we van  het gas af gaan. Een passende 
oplossing is er nog niet. Op korte termijn gaat niet gebeuren, wel een keertje. Ik stel ze 
gerust. ” 
Advies over energiebesparende maatregelen  
Er worden door mont eurs ook meerdere  voorbeelden aange dragen van hoe ze klanten 
adviseren energie te besparen door het gedrag aan te passen, isolerende maatregelen te 
treffen  of door hun ketel beter te laten inregelen.  Sommige monteurs noemen voorbeelden 
uit hun eigen thuissituatie, hetgeen heel overtuigend kan overkomen.   
18 
 
− “Ik heb een warmte camera , daarmee zie je de warmtelekken. Klanten zijn er blij mee. Bij 
klanten raakt de vloerverwarming langzaam verstopt, met warmtecamera kan je dat gelijk 
laten zien. Het maakt het tastbaar, dat ontbreekt vaak.”  
− “Ik zeg ook vaak: stookgedrag aanpassen, lampen uit doen, isoleren. Dan bespaar je al zo 
veel.”  
− “Als mensen vragen naar verduurzamen  zeg ik ; ga je dak, vloer,  wand isoleren, dat is wat je 
allemaal nu kan doen. Langzaam stappen maken .” 
− “Vroeger had je een campagne van de overheid van zet je thermostaat een graad lager. Ik 
kom in huizen waar het 24 graden  is, dan zeg ik,  is dat nou echt wel nodig. ” 
− “Als mensen een oude ketel hebben en iets nieuws nodig hebben  vragen ze: w at is de 
volgende stap? Ik vertel dan het grote plaatje: dit zijn de opties (volledig electrisch, hybride, 
weer  een ketel) in jip en janneketaal , en het kostenplaatje. Ik vertel ook dat het niet duidelijk 
is hoe de planning van de overheid is, maar dat isoleren altijd een goed idee is .” 
Wel of niet d oorverwijzen naa r of samenwerken met andere partijen  
Doorverwijzen naar andere partijen die specialist zijn op het gebied van bijvoorbeeld 
isoleren gebeurt wel eens, maar aan doorverwijzen kleven ook nadelen volgens sommige 
monteurs. Want hoe weet je zeker dat de an dere partij dezelfde kwaliteit en service levert 
als het eigen bedrijf ? En wellicht kost het je op termijn klanten.  
− “Ik ben juist vrij kritisch op doorverwijzen. Als je doorverwijst en het niet bevalt dan straalt 
het op ons af. Jullie hadden gezegd dat we h em moesten nemen. Klinkt heel kinderachtig 
maar wel realiteit. Daarom ben ik er terughoudend in. ” 
− “Ik verkoop wel eens een nee, dat is niet  het werk dat wij doen . Maar ik verwijs niet naar een 
ander bedrijf. Als ik naar een ander bedrijf doorverwijs gaat de klant daar misschien heen. Ik 
zou liever hebben dat <het installatiebedrijf> uitbreidt. ” 
 
5. ANDERE DREMPELS BIJ VERDUURZAMING SKEUZES EN -ADVIES  
 
Naast onduidelijkheid, kennisge sprek en kosten zijn er nog andere drempels die het maken 
van duurzamere keuzes door klanten  en het geven van advies daarover door monteurs  in 
de weg staan. Verduurzaming is bijvoorbeeld niet het eerste waar mensen over na gaan 
denken als de ketel stuk gaat bij min tien. In dit hoofdstuk worden deze en andere 
drempels uiteengezet.  
 
Timing : korte - en langetermijndenken  
Bij het afwegen van de opties voor verwarmen is de  uitgangssituatie van de klant van 
belang : als er sprake is van een storing en men zit in de kou, is dat niet het tijdstip om goed 
over de lange termijn na te denken.  
 
In het verlengde hiervan geven monteurs aan dat mensen het überhaupt lastig vinden om 
beslissingen te nemen die op de lange term ijn nut hebben, in plaats van te gaan voor de 
korte termijn.  
 
− “80% van mijn klanten zit in de kou als ik bij ze kom .”  
19 
 
− “Inregelen kost 500 euro. Dan betalen mensen nog liever 250 euro per jaar extra aan 
stookkosten. Ik betaal nog wel een tijdje. ” 
− “Bij <het installatiebedrijf > kan je voor 200 euro een advies aanvragen. Dat is de eerste 
drempel. Dan krijgen ze te horen: je be nt over 2 weken aan de beurt. Dan denken mensen: 
oké, doe dan maar een ketel .” 
− “Meeste mensen hebben wel iets van , wie dan leeft , wie dan zorgt.”  
 
Praktische nadelen  van duurzame oplossingen  
Het vaakst praten monteurs toch over de warmtepomp als het over de energietransitie 
gaat. Ze vertellen over de vele nadelen die in praktijk hieraan zijn verbonden  en waar 
klanten bezorgd over zijn. Het gaat over d e ruimte die wordt ingenomen door de 
apparatuur , dat er soms lawaai wordt ervaren  en de aanpassingen d ie aan de woning nodig 
zijn om een warmtepomp te kunnen gebruiken  (dit laatste onderwerp  werd eerder 
besproken bij ‘Kosten voor de gebruiker ’ in hoofdstuk 3 ). 
 
−  “Ruimte is ook een drempel. Mensen hebben geen ruimte voor warmtepomp. Ook herrie is 
een drempel. Laatst bij iemand, de buurman had buiten een warmtepomp geplaatst, 
mensen denken er over om een klacht in te gaan dienen vanwege geluidsoverlast.”  
− “En de ruimte, er moeten aanpassingen komen. Neem A’dam, R’dam waar studenten 
wonen, in het centrum,  je hebt geen eens ruimte om iets op te bergen.”  
− “Het kan heel goed : zonneboilers, het probleem is alleen dat in Nederland we in bijna alle 
huizen de technische installatie op zolder hebben staan. Ik denk dat in 60 -70% van de 
huurhuizen een vat van 300  liter niet kan staan.”  
− “Warmtepomp wordt soms door het dak geplaatst. Dan moet je na 10 jaar je dak eraf 
halen.”  
− “Op het moment , hoe het allemaal gaat met warmtepompen , dat zie ik niet als de toekomst. 
Dat komt door kosten, ruimte, lawaai. Misschien over een aantal jaren beter, misschien zijn 
het kinderziektes, maar op dit moment zie ik het niet als de oplossing. ” 
− “Het is ook niet goed duidelijk te krijgen dat ze de ther mostaat niet steeds omhoog en 
omlaag moeten doen. Sommigen hebben zelfs nog een pot thee op de kachel staan.”  
 
Negatieve verhalen over warmtepompen  
Monteurs wijzen erop dat mensen hun gewoonten en gedrag moeten aanpassen bij gebruik 
van de warmtepomp, het vergt een ander gebruik dan ze gewend zijn van de cv -ketel. Dit is 
veelal onbekend bij gebruikers  en zorgt voor negatieve verhalen over de werking van de 
warmtepomp.  
  
Daar naast is de ervaring van monteurs dat de f abrieks - en standaardinstellingen  van 
warmtepompen , maar ook van cv -ketels , meestal niet goed  zijn, wat effecten heeft op  het 
functioneren  en het energiegebruik  en ook tot negatieve verhalen kan leiden.  
  
20 
 
In het alg emeen geven monteurs aan dat de installatie van warmtepompen ingewikkelder is 
en ook dat de installatie nauwer luistert voor het goed functioneren ervan.  Daarom moeten 
er in sommige gevallen vaak monteurs langs gaan om een reparatie uit te voeren.  
 
De onbekendheid va n nieuwe technieken  
Technieken zoals warmtepompen staan volgens monteurs nog in de kinderschoenen. Dit 
maakt  dat er in perceptie nog weinig kennis is, zowel marktbreed als bij de monteurs zelf. 
Het is ook nog niet duidelijk hoeveel en welke fabrikanten als ‘winnaars’ uit de strijd gaan 
komen. Bijkomend zijn er ook aanloopproblemen in een nieuw segment als dit.  Zo ervaren 
de monteurs soms dat het moeilijk is om informatie te krijgen van de fabrikant over de 
warmtepomp.  
 
− “Klanten horen vooral v an de warmtepomp. Sommigen hebben wel eens gehoord van 
waterstof. Maar dat zijn er niet veel. Het staat in de kinderschoenen en er wordt 
geheimzinnig over gedaan. Je kan het zelf produceren. Dan ben je onafhankelijk van 
energiebedrijven. Dat willen ze natu urlijk niet, dus dat houden ze tegen.”  
− “Bij mijn afdeling is iedereen wel geïnteresseerd. Maar ik merk dat er geheimzinnig wordt 
gedaan over de wa rmte pomp. Je moet je identificeren voor je naar binnen mag. Je moet wel 
kunnen kijken om te kunnen leren. Ik denk , waarom zo ?” 
− “In het begin van een woningproject waar ik kwam , waren er heel veel problemen met 
warmtepompen, de fabrikant kon ook niks vertellen, ondersteuning was er niet…”  
− “Je weet vaak niet wat er eerder is gebeurd met een w armte pomp. Ji j bent nr 12 en jij moet 
het oplossen .” 
− “De t echniek is zulke sprongen aan het nemen,  het is moeilijk  er op te anticiperen .”

6. OPLOSSINGSRICHTINGEN DIE MONT EURS AANDRAGEN  
 
In de gesprekken is steeds gevraagd naar de oplossingsrichtingen die monteurs zelf zien om 
de energie transitie  te bespoedigen  en naar wat zij zelf nodig denken te hebben om hieraan 
een bijdrage te kunnen leveren . In onderstaande tabel de oplossingen  die door hen w erden 
aangedragen . 
 
VANUIT OVERHEID  
Overheid moet 
duidelijkheid scheppen 
over waar het naartoe 
gaat  met de 
energie transitie  en hoe.  
 Bovenaan de wensenlijst van  monteurs staat dat er duidelijkheid moet 
komen over de inho ud, de motivatie en de timing van het beleid  
rondom de energietransitie . Dit reduceert de  onzekerheid die er nu 
heerst onder bedrijven, burgers en de monte urs zelf. Hierdoor kunnen 
burgers beter beslissen en kunnen monteurs beter adviseren.  
 
Bijkomende wens is meer uniformiteit van beleid op gemeent eniveau . 
 
Men hoopt ook dat Nederland  in het beleid meer aansluiting zoek t met 
andere  Europese landen  (Scandinavië kent mooie voorbeelden volgens 
deelnemers) . 
 
De overheid kan 
producten aanbieden 
voor monteurs die 
adviseren 
ondersteunen.  Door bijvoorbeeld informatiefilmpjes en folders te maken en aan te 
bieden aan monteurs, kunnen zij zonder te veel tijd te verliezen advies 
geven aan de klant. Bijvoorbeeld over woningisolatie, de keuze voor 
een duurzamere manier van verwarmen en de beschikbare subsidies 
en middelen vanuit de overheid.  
 
De overheid zou n iet 
alleen maar moeten 
focussen op de 
warmtepomp , maar 
ook andere opties , 
zoals  isoleren actief 
moeten promoten.  
 Het beeld is dat er  vanuit de overheid  nu vrijwel alleen maar 
naar de warmtepomp gekeken wordt. Veel monteurs zien ook 
heil in isoleren, waterstof, zonneboilers of combinatie -
oplossingen .  
Soepeler e regels en 
subsidies  als 
oplossingsrichting   De monteurs dragen veel ideeën aan om een ruimhartiger, 
eenduidiger beleid te voeren met regels en subsidies voor 
milieuvriendelijker maatregelen  en energiezuinig bouwen   
− “In Limburg krijgen alle huurders zonnepanelen, hoeven ze niet 
voor te betalen maar het levert wel  veel op.” 
− “Groene stroom is duurder. Dan ga ik het toch niet afnemen? En 
dan is het niet eens groen .” 
 
Ook de omgekeerde optie wordt genoemd: bestr af 
onduurzaam gedrag.  
− “Waarom worden fabricanten niet gedwongen om vervuilende 
opties duur te maken en warmtepompten goedkoper? Waarom  
22 
 
is duurzaam niet goedkoop? CO2 taks? Dan worden groene 
alternatieven aantrekkelijker. ” 
 
Subsidies zouden centraler bekend moeten worden gemaakt 
en makkelijker toegankelijk worden gemaakt dan nu  het geval 
is. 
 
Verstandiger beleid  in 
de bouwsector  Volgens monteurs  wordt er nog niet goed genoeg nagedacht 
over sommige beslissingen bij nieuwbouw. Bijvoorbeeld alle 
nieuwbouw huizen  zouden  met het dak op het zuiden gericht 
moeten worden  (i.v.m. zonnepanelen).  
− “Huizen in de nieuwbouw moet ook anders gebouwd worden. 
Je kan voor 100 euro een ‘tegenstroomapparaat’ kopen maar 
dan verkopen de ontwikkelaars ze voor 800  euro . Daar word ik 
moe van ” 
 
Volgens sommige deelnemers kan er nog meer 
worden vooruit gedacht  bij bouwprojecten , bijvoorbeeld door 
rekening te houden met de ruimte voor apparatuur . 
 
 
Voorlichting en 
campagnes vanuit 
overheid  
 
 In perceptie moet er een duidelijker centraal punt komen 
waarop burgers zich kunnen informeren over de 
energietransitie.  
 
Meerdere monteurs hopen ook dat de overheid vroegere  
campagnes om energie te besparen weer nieuw leven 
inblaast.  
 
Volgens sommige monteurs zit de toon van het huidige verhaal een 
gedragsverandering in de weg: er ontstaat weerstand als er over 
verplichtingen of moeten wordt gepraat . Het benadrukken van de 
voordelen kan beter werken.  
− “Je moet niet over verplichtingen praten. Je moet het goede 
verhaal vertellen. Een positief verhaal. Van verplichten naar 
een verhaal waarbij mensen zelf tot inzicht komen. Dan 
gaan ze om .” 
 
Men ziet de informatie en de subsidies liever vanuit het rijk 
komen dan vanuit gemeentes . 
 
 
 
   
23 
 
 
 
 
VANUIT WERKGEVER  
 
Meer opleiding 
gewenst  Er is een duidelijke roep om meer informatie en opleiding , 
met name  over  warmtepompen , maar idealiter over bredere 
oplossingen . 
 
Door sommige deelnemers wordt toegevoegd dat een ‘simpel’ 
opleidings programma  niet genoeg zal zijn, maar dat een 
bredere verandering van de bedrijfsvoering nodig is.  
 
Ook het idee van (uitbreiding van) een kennisbank wordt 
geopperd.  
 
Monteurs 
gesubsideerd als 
‘showcase ’ laten 
dienen  
 
 Monteurs geloven dat als ze zelf met flinke korting of subsidie 
bepaalde oplossingen alvast in hun eigen huis kunnen 
uitproberen, dit ervoor zorgt dat ze hun verhaal en advies 
richting klanten n og beter over het voetlicht  kunnen brengen . 
Meer ruimte en 
gelegenheid geven 
voor advies  In een dagschema met 8 bezoeken kan men in perceptie nooit 
goed advies geven.   
 
Veel monteurs denken dat er niet van iedere monteur advies 
kan worden verwacht, maar dat er  met dedicated teams  moet 
worden gewerkt.   
− “Als monteur moet je een verhaaltje van 5 minuten kunnen 
vertellen en dan een lead voor een adviseur aanmaken. Zo’n 
warmtepomp van 8000 euro daar moet je goed over 
geadviseerd worden, daar moet je een servicemonteur niet 
mee opzadelen .” 
 
Men heeft behoefte 
aan meer 
ondersteuning, in de 
vorm van overzichten, 
tools en video 
materiaal  
 Met de tool van Milie ucentraal zijn er enkele eerste  
ervaringen opgedaan.   
Men zou daarnaast meer en duidelijker ‘tooling ’ wensen  en  
denkt daarbij aan beslisbomen, rekenvoorbeelden etc.  
 
Daarnaast zien monteurs veel in filmpjes.  
− “Filmpjes zijn heel handig. Ook over de warmtepomp hoe die 
werkt. Als je een filmpje hebt , van: verbouwen: hoe moet je dat 
doen, welke stappen? Dat scheelt mij veel tijd want ik moet 
nog naar 7 adressen. ” 
 
Noot van de 
onderzoeker:  
 In de sessies werd duidelijk dat sommige gepassioneerde 
monteurs inspirerend kunnen werken ri chting een anderen. Er 
kan worden nagedacht hoe de rol van dit soort 
‘ambassadeurs ’ kan worden uitgebreid, intern of extern.

BIJLAGE: SPECIFICATIES GESPREKKEN  
 
Twee  focusgroepen vonden plaats op een dependance van het installatiebedrijf en één op 
het hoofdkantoor, op de volgende data:   
 
Datum  Deelnemers  
Focusgroep 1:  
30 januari  2020  11 cv monteurs  (deels opleiders)  
Focusgroep 2:  
6 februari  2020  9 cv monteurs , opleiders , en teamleiders  
Focusgroep 3:  
7 februari  2020  6 cv monteurs   
Week 8 en 9 – Telefonische interviews  3 cv monteurs  
 
Met de kennissessies  hebben  het Behavio ural Insights Team van het M inisterie van 
Economische Zaken  en Klimaat en betrokkenen vanuit het installatiebedrijf meegeluisterd. 
Zij hebben aan het eind van elk gesprek verzoekvragen ingediend. De kennissessies zijn 
gemodereerd door Marielle Luif van Facts&More. De telefonische interviews zijn 
afgenomen door het Behavio ural Insights Team. Als le idraad voor het gesprek diende een 
topiclist, welke inhoudelijk is voorbereid  met zowel het Behavioral Insights Team als met 
het installatiebedrijf . 
 
De deelnemers zijn gerecruteerd door het installatiebedrijf zelf. De monteurs konden onder 
werktijd aan de sessies deelnemen, aangezien ze werden uitgeroosterd . De manier van 
uitnodigen: een open oproep aan personeelsleden om deel te nemen aan een kennissessie 
over de overgang naar duurzame energie, maakt het waarschijnlijk  dat zich vooral  
deelnemers aanmeldden  die enige affiniteit hebben met dit onderwerp. Dit moet bij de 
interpretatie van de uitkomsten in gedachten worden gehouden. De kans is groot dat  in 
een willekeurige steekproef van monteurs de affinit eit lager zou zijn. 
 
Deelnemers i s anonimiteit gegarandeerd. Er zijn wel -met toestemming - geluidsopname n 
gemaakt van de gesprekken en er zijn aantekeningen gemaakt. In deze verslaglegging  is 
gebruik gemaakt van geanonimiseerde citaten ter illustratie van de resultaten.

Bovendien meestal bereid zoveel geld onduidelijke terugverdientijd. − Subsidies ogen monteurs onbekend, veranderlijk, ontoereiken lastig daad werkelijk verkrijgen . − speelt ov erkoepelende vraag betaalbaar energietransitie niveau maatschappij , angst burger uiteindelijk degene kosten opdraait . Adviesrol cv monteurs Monteurs krijgen verwacht, energietransitie. Bijvoorbeeld stellen vraag: “Ik ouwe ketel. Moet warmtepomp nemen? ” Monteurs merken henzelf gebrek kennis verduurzaming energiebesparende maatregelen. Om goed advies geven, vinden monteurs weinig kennis : − Bij henzelf : teveel merken mark praktijk komen monteurs warmtepomp tegen. − In algemeen markt : markt warmtepompen versnipperd soms geheimzinnigheid omgeven, fabrikanten weinig informatie . − En bedr ijf: vraagt kennis, vorm opleiding, bijv. filmmateriaal . hangt o.a. eigen interesse duurzaamheid, karaktereigenschappen af graag advies geeft. tijd belangrijke drempel advi es. Service onteurs algemeen 8 dag lastig combineren goed advies verduurzaming woning. meeste monteurs vinden begrijp elijk zoveel tijd h et verdienmodel ontbreekt ; advies kost tijd kost levert weinig . In praktijk geeft mede vanwege gebrek kennis advies warmtepomp , ofwel adviseert keer nieuwe cv -ketel nemen. M onteurs verder bespaaradviezen woning , aanbrengen tochtstrips besparend gedrag. algehele tendens gesprekken meeste monteurs mening adviserende rol verwacht mont eurs. gebaseerd optelsom onduidelijkheid energietransitie, gecombineerd praktische bezwaren adviseren (gebrek kennis, gebrek tijd, verdienmodel bedrijf, etc.).

Wensen monteurs potentiële oplossingsrichtingen monteurs noemen Hoog wensenlijst monteurs staat duidelijkheid overheidsbeleid t.a.v. energietransitie. Verder monteurs meerdere oplossingsrichtingen energie -transitie bevorderen, deels erop gericht rol schakel richting burger groter maken. − Niet uitsluitend focussen warmtepomp, opties isoleren, waterzijdig inregelen, waterstof, zonneboilers combinatie -oplossingen . − Voorlichting campagnes vanuit overheid gewenst . − Velen verwachten soepeler regels subsidies oplossing zullen bieden . − Meer opleiding vanuit werkgever (en fabrikanten) gew enst . − Meer tools ondersteuning vorm filmpjes , folders monteurs mee klanten, ander voorlichtingsmateriaal . − Móchten monteurs adviseren, tijd ruimte dagschema v advies (met bijbehorend ander verdienmodel installatiebedrij ven). − Monteurs flinke korting subsidie duurzamere apparatuur aanschaffen , verhaal advies richting beter voetlicht brengen . 6 1. INLEIDING EN ACHTERGROND Om leren rol cv monteurs energietransitie Ministerie Economische Zaken Klimaat samenwerking installatieb edrijf 3 ‘kennissessies’ ( focusgroepen ) georganiseerd 26 cv monteurs , teamleiders , opleiders begin februari 2020. drie telefonische interviews uitgevoerd monteurs. verwachting vooraf monteurs belangrijke rol (kunnen) spelen transitie . Uit eerder onderzoek blijkt namelijk monteurs krijgen energietransitie . Focuspunten gesprekken zijn: − Hoe speelt onderwerp duurzaamheid tijdens bezo eken klanten? soort stellen klanten? − Hoe kijken monteurs advies duurzaamheid nieuwe technieken? Waarop baseren advies? − Waar liggen eventuele drempels advies? monteurs helpen? inzichten kennissessies interviews helpen kaart brengen welke initiatieven Rijksoverheid ontwikkelen monteurs ondersteunen energietransitie. 2. ACHTERGROND MONTEURS Er tijdens focusgroep tijd besteed kaart brengen achtergrond monteurs. Ervaring, functie w erkomstandigheden We zagen gesprekken mix tussen monteurs tientallen jaren monteur werken hetzelfde bedrijf, monteurs korter bedrijf verbonden. Vooral oudere monteurs vertellen graag jarenlange ervaring , waarin ontwikkelingen zagen voorbijkomen : − “Ik langs komen loop tijd, eerst komst cv -ketel, kwam HR -ketel weer warmtepomp ”. Veel onteurs onderhouds monteur storingsmonteur particulieren : leggen dagelijks 8 bezoeken af kla nten. zorgt vrij hoge werkdruk geeft monteur perceptie bijna (te) weinig tijd spenderen iedere klant. − “Als vragen: h eb ouwe ketel. Moet warmtepomp? kijk monteur bonnen. anderhalf uur praten zo’n klant, voel werkdruk .” Sommige monteurs werken grotere installatie projecten , o.a. zakelijke klanten, woningbouwcorporaties . Meerdere deelnemers teamleider , en/of houden (een deel tijd) bezig opleiden jongere monteurs. 7 Geïnteresseerden onderwerp energietransitie oproep kennissessie thema geresulteerd groep onderwerp geïnteresseerde (dit vooraf verwacht) . In alle drie groepen zaten 1 monteurs erg bevlogen onderwerp. Sommige n maken sport duurzaam bezig zijn. Verschillende monteurs thuissituatie extra duurzame constructies staan experimenteren hiermee. Zij vertellen klanten. − “Ik ïnteresseerd nieuwe technieken. Interesse al, vanuit huis meegekregen. ” − “Ik installeren, zit dicht vuur. warmtepompboiler thuis neergehangen, kijken gaat dat, functioneert , gaat geluid, proefondervindelijk. ” − “Ik 10 jaar bezig warmtepompen. l aatste jaar eigen huurwoning bezig kijken doen, onafhankelijk verhuurder. Nu elkaar gekregen zonnepanelen heb. behoorlijk overschot, daarom boiler bezig (…) H eb gas 1/3 beneden gekregen. , gemiddelde part iculier 12 -14000 Euro kosten. kijken elektrische boiler. Die ga Duitsland kopen, stuk goedkoper. “ monteurs koppelen terug inschatten vergeleken collega’s relatief affiniteit onderwerp. − “Ik denk weinigen enthousiast is. Veel collega’s positief. Op feestjes uren badkamer praten, verwarmen vinden mense n leuk. Maar goede verhaal vertelt , enthousiast ”. - “De meesten boeit niet. Die uitleggen installatie af stellen isoleren ”. − “Ik milieufreak. zeg dan: niets. Je ziet dingen veranderen goed grond halen manier is. Als collega’s sceptisch , overleven ’n sfeer ”. 8 3. DE TWEE BELANGRIJKSTE DREMPELS VOOR MONT EURS IN DE ENERGIE TRANSITIE Er spelen twee grote thema ’s volgens monteurs drempel energietransitie : 1.) onduidelijkheid overheid beleid 2.) Geld betaalbaarheid . kwamen alle gesprekken prominent voren: Onduidelijkheid overheid beleid t.a.v. energietransitie Volgens monteurs standpunt beleid overheid thema energietransitie onduidelijk. belangrijkste monteurs, volgens hen burgers, leven zijn: In algemeenheid: overheid naartoe wanneer ? overheid predikt perceptie: ‘We gas af’. Maar monteurs duidelijk betekent. Men weet zeker Gronings gas aardgas gaa t. Daarbij vraagt af: verplichting gas af gaan? En ja, gehandhaafd (NB: sommige monteurs verwachten handhaving , hoewel overheid theorie hoeft handhaven gas leiding komen ). 1. Is energietransitie feit? Er heerst twijfel energietransitie daadwerkelijk gaat gebeuren twijfel eraan überhaupt is. Er monteurs twijfels praktische haalbaarheid overgang. brengen vraag ter sprake infrastructuur, i.c. lectriciteitsnetten aankunnen. − “De overheid gas af, tevoren doen. Want k lant krijgt nieuws horen 2040 gas af. Oh, ja, peperduur apparaat kopen. (…) geeft onrust onzekerheid, klant installatiebranche .” − “Het fijn helder duidelijk beleid , gevolgd allerlei partij politieke doelstellingen belangen. Op gegeven moment komen weer verkiezingen mooi, nieuw kabinet weer bijgesteld .” − “Er eerst geroepen pas nagedacht overheid. voorbeeld warmtepompen. Er warmtepompen markt overal zit subsidie op. Daald erop enige waarbij koelvloeistof grond hoeft doen. Maar marktwerking meer. Maar alle keuze kiezen weer ketel ” − “Van ‘gas’ af…? We Gronings aardgas af. anders ”. − “Ik moest keer ketel maken man Den Haag werkte. (…) Die man gaf aan: 2050 makkelijk ketels plaatsen. gedeeld collega’s ”. − “Ik denk NL aardgas afgaat, helemaal niet. Daar onze infra toereikend denk ik. Als hele straat vol legt zonnepanelen, zon schijnt, wilt allemaal terugleveren net, blijkt capaciteit net voldoende is. ” 9 2. Wanneer bedoeling Nederland ‘van gas af ’ is? Er perceptie geschoven jaartallen . − “Als nieuws krijg vragen. Bijvoorbeeld 2 jaar geleden verteld vanaf 2021 ketels mochten verkocht. Toen kreeg vragen, nieuws zegt , klopt zeg maar. Dan zeker kwartier half uur vertellen: loopt zo’n vaart niet. Koop ieder geval nieuwe ketel.” − “Die zakelijke opdrachtgevers drie data hoofd; 2020 , 2030 2050. 2030 lijkt ver weg. Is dichtbij. Die denken duurt paar kabinetten, misschien beleid helemaal bijgedraaid. We zorgen eerst 2020 gemiddeld label B zitten …” − “Hier steeds onduidelijk gaat gebeuren. Nu zeggen weer 2030 afgebouwd .” 3. gemeente Rijk? Bijkomend element onduidelijkheid overheid, niveau waarop overheidsbeleid bepaald uitgevoerd. monteurs lastig beleid gemeente verschilt. Er monteurs voorbeelden aangehaald onduidelijke situaties verwarring zorgen : − “De plannen gemeente, zitten wachten. Die iedereen duidelijk. gemeenten [onderling] verschil plannen gemeente anders uit, ande teksten. eigenlijk samenwerken. lastig. ” − “Met name gemeenten, plan zijn. We roepen wacht gebiedsindelingen , ga pas beslissing nemen.” − “Bij z onne -energie bijvoorbeeld. gemeente verschillend. moeilijk. ” 4. Duurzame geopolitieke motivatie? betreft vraag : overheidsbeleid vooral duurzame motivatie, beslissing ingegeven geopolitieke motieven? Omdat werkelijke motivatie beleid helder is, ontstaat extra twijfel meegaan omschakel ing energiebron (aard)gas. − “Je basis kennis kunde verhaal vertellen, weet helemaal klopt. Nederlandse Aardoliemaatschappij aandelen gekocht Russisch gas. Waarom gedaan? We gas af, investeren in. raar. Russisch gas , allemaal warmtepomp?” − “Ik denk gevoel energietransitie puur maken draaien Groningen dicht , afhankelijk meneer Poetin Rusland. Financieel gedreven. We hoeven helemaal gas af, gas genoeg wereld. Maar ( moeten) onze begroting spekken. speelt. Bijna iedere klant hoor .” 10 5. Verschillen tussen Europese landen energ iebeleid Europese landen anders. In sommige landen aard gas juist duurzame energievorm gezien gestimuleerd. roept zowel monteurs weer . − “Als Duitse bewoners gas overgaan krijgen subsidie 6000 euro. verhaal media. vertrouwen overheid weg. Als doorgaat doet niemand .” − “Ik iscussie klanten: gas af , Italie Duitsland juist gas gaan? Ja , antwoord zeg , politiek spel. maakt grote geheel uit. We krijgen uitstoot buren binnen. ” 6. Twijfel focus warmtepomp Hierbij gaat vraag warmtepomp enige en/of juiste keuze focussen. Monteurs af w aarom overheid -in perceptie - optie stelt , juist optie? Er opties, waarin geloof heerst sommige monteurs , waterstof . − “Wie zegt allemaal warmtepomp moeten? media zeggen dat. Er transitie wat. transitie? Geen fossiele brandstoffen ... Mínder fossiele brandstoffen .... Maar ‘wkk’ transitie. (NB= Warmte -krachtkoppelin g). Waterstofketeltje transitie. En zonnepanelen .” − “Volgens waterstof oplossing. buurt waterstofmolen bouwen. ” − ”Er winnen gedrag passen, anders stoken. adviseer combi -ketel zonneboiler. scheelt aanzienlijk gas. gedaan krijg geld terug .” − “Wat gaat gebeuren toekomst? Electrische tegels? Waterstof? Warmtepomp? wacht even …” − “Je pties geven: warmtepomp één ding. Er dingen mogelijk. Die vertellen klant.” − “Waterstof goed alternatief. 10% waterstof aardgas gooien. grote bedrijven Shell tegengehouden. ” gevolgen onduidelijkheid overheidsbeleid zijn: * monteur prettig o.a. vanwege onduidelijkheid burgers beantwoorden. Over advies: hoofdstuk 4 - Monteurs adviesrol. * aanzienlijk deel monteurs sceptische houding tegenover overheidsb eleid ten aanzien energietransitie, zelfs negatieve houding . Velen twijfelen eraan daadwerkelijk gas af gaan. communiceren desgevraagd klanten. onduidelijkheid weerhoudt volgens monteurs burgers nemen beslissing. * Meerdere monteurs aarzelende burger vanuit zichzelf adviseren nieuwe cv -ketel schaffen. Hierover Hoofdstuk 4. 11 Geld betaalbaarheid volgens monteurs nagenoeg even groot issue onduidelijkheid overheidsbeleid , financiële thema: zit betaalbaarheid transitie duurzame energie ? vraag betaalbaarheid speelt alle niveaus : portemonee individuele burger , totale betaalbaarheid energi etransitie maatschappij. thema Geld betaalbaarheid valt uiteen drie onderdelen : kosten gebruiker, subsidies betaalbaarheid maatschappij geheel. 1. Kosten gebruiker Monteurs iswaar warmtepomp , monteur kostenplaatje schetst: 8000 euro pomp isoleren, verbleken klanten. Veel helemaal budget aanschafkosten dragen. Andere klante n wellicht budget beschikbaar , liever zaken duurzame energie. Daarbij duidelijk snel aanschafkosten kunt terug verdienen, zeker beleid overheid (in perceptie) zwalkt. brengt onzekerheid. − “Heel schuin dak. Mijn schoonouders wilden zonnepanelen, iedereen raadt af. installatie duur weinig zonnepanelen kunnen, rendabel.” − “Wat horen bang overheid energiemaatschappijen hen oplichten. Bijvoorbeeld salderingsregeling, neem zonnepanelen , belasting betalen gunstig verkopen. bang gunstige optie gunstig blijft. gaat best diep thuis. Als vertrouwen hebt best lastig. Met alle duurzame opties merk dat.” − “Mensen af oplevert terugverdientijd erg lang. kost ze. “ Er alle groepen voorbeelden geschetst hoge aanschafkosten warmtepomp vele malen hoger liggen kosten cv -ketel . En substantiëler: komen hoge kosten woning passen geschikt maken . Monteurs vertellen ervaringen voorhand welwillend warmtepomp overwegen , praktijk afhaken prijskaartje. − “Het draait geld. bewon ers graag verduurzamen, kostenplaatje gaat uiteindelijk betalen. Als keuze maken tussen warmtepomp 8000 euro keteltje 1500 euro, keuze snel gemaakt. ” − “Een goed hybride syst eem (hybride warmtepomp) kost 8000 euro, denken 1500 euro kost. Mensen verschieten daarvan. ” − “Heel warmtepomp, schrikken terug beetje richtprijs krijgen. moeten, wille n wel, gas af , totdat kosten horen.” 12 − “Mensen isoleren, snel gekeken prijs. woning klaar maken warmtepomp kost geld, niet. Geld allerbelangrijkste. ” − “Het kosten, isolatie, ramen. Je hele installatie, systeem aangepast worden. ” 2. Subsidies onbekend lastig werkelijk verkrijgen Tijdens kennissessies komen subsidies veelvuldig ter sprake . Er volgens monteurs weinig subsidiegeld beschi kbaar . bestaat onduidelijkheid welke subsidies welke gevallen aangevraagd . aanvragen subsidies werkt praktijk mak kelijk monteurs aan. D timing uitvoeren keuze soort werkzaamheden luistert erg nauw. monteurs onvoorspelbaar vinden wanneer subsidies aangepast . − “Ik vloerverwarming isolatie, nieuw dak unidekpanelen. Nul subsidie. Maar isolatieplaten dak sla, krijg subsidie. vorige zomer pas aangepast. Dan denk , snappen niet. Bij zat in. vond dingetje. ” − “Er subsidies, beperkt. Nieuwbouw [woning] krijgen.” − “Sommigen spaarpot anderen niet. Sommigen zeggen: besparen, vind leuk. Als verwijst subsidies overheidswebsites, inloggen Digid, adviseur heen. kost moeite.” − “Dan vraag subsidie aan, 1250 euro (…) krijg bericht , termijn verlengd 8 weken . weet krijg , pot eind nov ember leeg. (…) Dan mag jan uari opnieuw indienen, subsidie 1250 500 euro geworden. net trigger doen. “ − “Als zegt kost bespaart , zie subsidies laag zijn. zonne -energie bijvoorbeeld. En gemeente verschillend. moeilijk. ” Monteurs overigens juist richting subsidiebeleid potentiële oplossingen overgang duurzame energie. Zie hierover hoofdstuk 6 Oplossingsrichtingen monteurs aandragen . 3. Hoe betaalbaar (en haalbaar) energietransitie niveau maatschappij ? Gekoppeld sceptische houding sommige monteurs hebben, klinkt kennissessies geloof uiteindelijk burger prijskaartje duurzame energie betaalt, beleid ingericht. − “Het gevaar financieel aantrekkelijk maken uiteindelijk betalen .” − “Als gas gebruiken, gaat belasting gas omhoog. Per saldo ga betalen. Uiteindelijk ergens vandaan komen . Als burger vanuit overheid garantie : ga besparen gas, ga daadwerkelijk betalen. ” 13 4. MONTEURS EN DE ADVIESROL : KENNIS, HOUDING EN GEDRAG Er tijdens focusgroepen gesproken stellen, monteurs aankijken advies duurzaamheid nieuwe technieken waarop monteurs advies baseren. besproken w aar eventuele drem pels liggen advies . Tot slot besproken monteurs hierin helpen . Vragen energietransitie Monteurs koppelen terug inderdaad burgers aangesproken onderwerp ‘Nederland v gas af’. Veelal zo’n gesprek onduidelijkheid overheidsbeleid ter sprake (en gepraat dezelfde thema’s genoemd Hoofdstuk 3). Burgers stellen monteur vraag hen verstandig kader ‘van gas af gaan’. Monteurs hierop duidelijk antwoord schuldig blijven, . 1. Vragen stellen monteurs lopen zeer uiteen: ­ ou ketel. Moet warmtepomp nemen? ­ beste ketel vervangen worden? ­ Is verstandig ketel kopen, lang blijven gebruiken? ­ Hoe lang duurt aanschaf warmtepomp terug verdiend? ­ Kan geiser af warm water? ­ Hoe verduurzamen, volgende stap woning? ­ Mag warmte unit pomp buiten staan? ­ Is huis geschikt warmtepomp? ­ biomassa? ­ gaat gebeuren kolencentrales dicht gaan? ­ Kan zonnepanelen duurzaam stoken? ­ alternatief warmtepomp? ­ Hoeveel subsidie krijgen warmtepomp? ­ Welke radiator nemen warmtepomp? 2. monteur bron kennis Meerdere onteurs spontaan zichzelf belangrijke bron burgers advies krijgen . Daarmee versterken gedachte Behavioural Insights Team Ministerie Economische zaken Klimaat cv monteurs belangrijke schakel energietransitie. − “Mensen geloven monteur eerder buiten.” − “Mensen verzuipen alle informatie, zoeken verzuipen informatie klikken weg denken, wacht monteur .” − “Wij staan verwarmingsmonteurs linie” 14 Monteurs nemen gebrek kennis onderwerp . Er weinig kennis meerdere terreinen: ­ Er g ebrek kennis ver volgorde verduurzaming, woning eerst isoleren voordat woning geschikt technieken warmtepomp. ­ Klanten algemeen weinig energiebesparende maatregelen inregelen cv- ketel . ­ Er warmtepomp g ebrek ke nnis ver h oe warmtepomp juist gebruiken, anders werkt cv- ketel. belangrijk pomp steeds - word gezet, consequenties werking apparaat. leidt fout gebruik v warmtepomp praktijk, slechte verhalen warmtepomp kortere levensduur apparaten. ­ Er algemeen weinig besef h et belang constante verwarming zuinigheid. adviesrol: Kennis, houding gedrag monteurs monteurs terugkoppelen advies , gestructureerd drie elementen: kennis, houding gedrag . drie elementen hierna uitgebreider toegelicht geïllustreerd citaten. 1 KENNIS 2 HOUDING 3 GEDRAG Er sprake weinig kennis volgens monteurs : - In algemeen markt - Bij henzelf - En bedrijf Grondhouding t.a.v adviseren hangt af van: - Eigen interesse/passie duurzaamheid - Opleidingsniveau functie - Of pen staat werkzaamheden primair opgeleid . In praktijk geeft veelal : - Ofwel advies - Of adviseert keer nieuwe cv - ketel nemen Men doet bespaar adviezen, tochtstrips , besparend gedrag , aanschaf zuinigere cv -ketel. 1. Te weinig kennis goed adviseren In praktijk advies lastig, monteurs vinden weinig kennis energietransitie apparatuur perceptie geacht adviseren (namelijk warmtepompen) . gebrek kennis maken zaken. hieronder weergegeven. Op hoogte overheidsplannin g onduidelijkheid monteurs ervaren vanuit overhei (zie Hoofdstuk 3). Hoe kun adviseren weet zit naartoe gaat? − “Ik hoef leggen apparaat gerepareerd worden, duidelijk verhaal vertellen. vertel wandelgangen hoor. 15 ontwikkelingen staan stil. Er mogelijkheden serieus ingaan, serieuze cursus volgen, klant duidelijk verhaal vertellen. En klant tafel zitten bespreken beste past. Als duidelijk verhaal is, gaat mens overstag.” − “We zitten onzekere periode. We naartoe z’n allen. soms technische uni e, schrijf ervoor in. Op uni laten nieuwe technieken zien. Je hebt allemaal, duur prototype. Dus word t, weet adviseren. ” − “Ik vind b elangrijk ‘eerlijke verhaal’ vertellen klanten. Maar w eerlijke verhaal? ” onzekerheid n ieuw techniek relatief nieuw apparatuur warmtepomp (zie paragraaf 5.4). In nieuwe markt bestaan v eel onzekerheden gevestigde markt , gebruik, ser vice, et cetera. − “Mensen zekerheid. kom Zeeland, rijd middl nowhere kapot. Als warmtepomp monteurs doen. ” − “Wat lastig is: v ertel waarheid? Klopt zegt. Je eigenlijk adviseren waarvan weet zit. Je houdt lekkers later haal weer weg. Grote variatie aanbod warmtepompen grote aantal warmtepompen markt soms gebrekkige ondersteuning fabrikanten anders cv -ketels. Doordat w armte pompen zijn, warmtepompen monteur genoeg goed leren kennen . Daarbij installeren warmtepomp technisch ingewikkelder installatie ligt gevoeliger cv-ketel . juiste werking hangt af juiste wer kwijze monteur. aansluiting cv hy bride ingewikkeld. klant expert Klanten geïnteresseerd duurzame energie oplossing, soms kennis monteur. maakt advies extra lastig. − “Een drempel info opzoeken Google daarom warmtepomp monteur. kla nt vraagt advies weet gevallen beter ik. moeilijk. offertes opgevraagd informatie opgevraagd. goed adviseren, weet warmtepompen. tijd zoeken.” − “Klanten verwachting. Kijk onderhouden repareren ketels warmtepompen enz. steeds ziet monteurs bestookt adviseur. stellen vragen, leiden monteurs helemaal op, helemaal vraag niet. erheen ketel onderhouden , advies. ” 2. Houding t.a.v. advis eren Of monteurs advies meerdere factoren beïnvloed . 16 Duurzaamheid eigen houding ten opzichte duurzaamheid speelt rol bereidheid klant hierover adviseren. D paar monteurs echt gepassioneerd hierover advis eren graag, buiten werk lopen hiervoor extra hard, lijkt het. − “Ik vind leuk, trek soms tijd leggen is. Dan vraag , bieden jullie zeg ver niet. zit krap tijd graag doen. ”’ ­ “Ik word enthousiaster gebruik kennis ervaring. tijd leuker techneuten leuk vinden. Als zeggen werken werkbaar maken. werken. Als zeggen ga oplossing zoeken” . Openstaan aanvullende werkzaamheden In hoeverre persoon open staat werkzaamheden primair opgeleid . − “Als lang dienst niks anders gewend lastig switch maken. Die ketels, zelfs mechanische ventilatie gek. 8 4 werken huis ”. − “Sommige collega’s luisteren vertel. entaliteit verandert. Jongere soms 8 5 mentaliteit, interesseert niet. Warmtepompen kosten tijd .” − “Ik vind leuk adviseren. […]. praat graag mensen. denk ondernemend hou problemen oplossen. Met praten vind mooiste vak. Als vol passie uitleggen doe graag.” 3. Gedrag : adviseren monteurs? Monteurs w einig tijd beschikbaar , cv-ketel adviseren tijdens werk bespaartips gegeven . Te weinig tijd In perceptie weinig tijd gesprekken klant (over welk onderwerp ook, duurzaamheid). Maar juist goed advies duurzame oplossingen kost tijd, ervaring monteurs. Tijd hebben. verschilt mogelijkheid advies functie. E storingsmonteur 8 dag afwerkt , uitgangssituatie mogelijkheden speciaal belast opleiden monteurs thema duurzaamheid . algehele tendens alle gesprekken heen, (op enkele zeer gepassioneerde personen na) meeste monteurs standpunt staan adviserende rol verwacht monteurs . gebaseerd optelsom onduidelijkheid energietransitie, gecombineerd praktische bezwaren adviseren (gebrek kennis, gebrek tij d, verdienmodel bedrijf, etc .). personen positiever staan tegenover adviserende rol monteurs, daarbij veranderen echt ver zijn: zowel betreft kennisniveau personeel, beschikbare tijd krijgt klant. 17 − “In uur klant uitleggen goede volgorde is, wereld elkaar zit. Klant vragen, gehoord. Die denkt warmtepomp, jij uitleggen welke voorwaarden voldoen. Stookgedrag, isoleren. Je A beginnen uitleggen, koelkast warmtepomp krijgt bier koud dagje nodig. gewend ketel, kost 1800 euro, half uur maak prijs vast, offerte keteltje verkocht. Er verhaal bij” − “Ik servicemonteur. overal lange verhalen vertellen.” verdienmode l installatiebedrijf speelt rol. Meerdere deelnemers refereren bedrijfsvoering installatiebedrijf: verdienmodel onverstandig tijd gespendeerd advies terwijl verkoopt. − “We bedrijf voeren, horen inkomsten salarissen bij. We vinden leuk adviseren, houden droog brood moment. maakt lastig onderneming .” Cv- ketel advies komende jaren In gesprekken word meermaals verteld praktijk advies vanuit monteurs warmtepomp gaan, cv -ketel steeds meest verstandige oplossing komende jaren. − “Eigenlijk standaard advies - durf bijna zeggen - neem cv -ketel, eerlijke verhaal. En doorverwijzen adviseurs, kost teveel teveel tijd, weinig kennis adviseurs .” − “Mijn antwoord oppervlakkig, ga echt diep. zeg geloof korte termijn gas af gaan. reken cv-ketel beste oplossing is.” − “Probeer leggen particuliere klant bijv. keuze tussen keteltje 1800 Euro hoeft verder niks krijgt goed warm water investering 10 -15000 euro, misschien 30 -40. Dan keuze moeilijk .” − “Ook kennissenkring, nichtje nieuwe ketel opgehangen. Moet warmtepomp nemen? Neem nou keteltje voorlopig even klaar. Dan isoleren. zoveel besteden, lastig . adviseer je…” − “Als monteur zie snel gebeuren gas af gaan. passende oplossing niet. Op korte termijn gaat gebeuren, keertje. stel gerust. ” Advies energiebesparende maatregelen Er mont eurs meerdere voorbeelden aange dragen adviseren energie besparen gedrag passen, isolerende maatregelen treffen ketel beter laten inregelen. Sommige monteurs noemen voorbeelden eigen thuissituatie, hetgeen overtuigend overkomen. 18 − “Ik warmte camera , daarmee zie warmtelekken. Klanten blij mee. Bij raakt vloerverwarming langzaam verstopt, warmtecamera gelijk laten zien. maakt tastbaar, ontbreekt vaak.” − “Ik zeg vaak: stookgedrag aanpassen, lampen doen, isoleren. Dan bespaar veel.” − “Als verduurzamen zeg ; ga dak, vloer, wand isoleren, allemaal doen. Langzaam stappen maken .” − “Vroeger campagne overheid zet thermostaat graad lager. kom huizen 24 graden is, zeg ik, nou echt nodig. ” − “Als oude ketel nieuws ze: w volgende stap? vertel grote plaatje: opties (volledig electrisch, hybride, weer ketel) jip janneketaal , kostenplaatje. vertel duidelijk planning overheid is, isoleren goed idee .” Wel oorverwijzen naa r samenwerken partijen Doorverwijzen partijen specialist gebied isoleren gebeurt eens, doorverwijzen kleven nadelen volgens sommige monteurs. Want weet zeker dere partij dezelfde kwaliteit service levert eigen bedrijf ? En wellicht kost termijn klanten. − “Ik juist vrij kritisch doorverwijzen. Als doorverwijst bevalt straalt af. Jullie hadden gezegd h em moesten nemen. Klinkt kinderachtig realiteit. Daarom terughoudend in. ” − “Ik verkoop nee, werk . Maar verwijs ander bedrijf. Als ander bedrijf doorverwijs gaat klant misschien heen. liever <het installatiebedrijf> uitbreidt. ” 5. ANDERE DREMPELS BIJ VERDUURZAMING SKEUZES EN -ADVIES Naast onduidelijkheid, kennisge sprek kosten drempels maken duurzamere keuzes advies daarover monteurs weg staan. Verduurzaming eerste denken ketel stuk gaat min tien. In hoofdstuk drempels uiteengezet. Timing : korte - langetermijndenken Bij afwegen opties verwarmen uitgangssituatie klant belang : sprake storing zit kou, tijdstip goed lange termijn denken. In verlengde hiervan monteurs überhaupt lastig vinden beslissingen nemen lange term ijn nut hebben, plaats korte termijn. − “80% zit kou kom .” 19 − “Inregelen kost 500 euro. Dan betalen liever 250 euro jaar extra stookkosten. betaal tijdje. ” − “Bij <het installatiebedrijf > 200 euro advies aanvragen. eerste drempel. Dan krijgen horen: nt 2 weken beurt. Dan denken mensen: oké, doe ketel .” − “Meeste , leeft , zorgt.” Praktische nadelen duurzame oplossingen vaakst praten monteurs warmtepomp energietransitie gaat. vertellen vele nadelen praktijk hieraan verbonden bezorgd zijn. gaat ruimte ingenomen apparatuur , soms lawaai ervaren aanpassingen ie woning warmtepomp gebruiken (dit laatste onderwerp eerder besproken ‘Kosten gebruiker ’ hoofdstuk 3 ). − “Ruimte drempel. Mensen ruimte warmtepomp. herrie drempel. Laatst iemand, buurman buiten warmtepomp geplaatst, denken klacht dienen vanwege geluidsoverlast.” − “En ruimte, aanpassingen komen. Neem A’dam, R’dam studenten wonen, centrum, hebt ruimte bergen.” − “Het goed : zonneboilers, probleem Nederland bijna alle huizen technische installatie zolder staan. denk 60 -70% huurhuizen vat 300 liter staan.” − “Warmtepomp soms dak geplaatst. Dan 10 jaar dak eraf halen.” − “Op moment , allemaal gaat warmtepompen , zie toekomst. kosten, ruimte, lawaai. Misschien aantal jaren beter, misschien kinderziektes, moment zie oplossing. ” − “Het goed duidelijk krijgen ther mostaat steeds omhoog omlaag doen. Sommigen zelfs pot thee kachel staan.” Negatieve verhalen warmtepompen Monteurs wijzen erop gewoonten gedrag aanpassen gebruik warmtepomp, vergt ander gebruik gewend cv -ketel. veelal onbekend gebruikers zorgt negatieve verhalen werking warmtepomp. Daar naast ervaring monteurs f abrieks - standaardinstellingen warmtepompen , cv -ketels , meestal goed zijn, effecten functioneren energiegebruik negatieve verhalen leiden. 20 In alg emeen monteurs installatie warmtepompen ingewikkelder installatie nauwer luistert goed functioneren ervan. Daarom sommige gevallen monteurs langs reparatie voeren. onbekendheid va n nieuwe technieken Technieken warmtepompen staan volgens monteurs kinderschoenen. maakt perceptie weinig kennis is, zowel marktbreed monteurs zelf. duidelijk hoeveel welke fabrikanten ‘winnaars’ strijd komen. Bijkomend aanloopproblemen nieuw segment dit. Zo ervaren monteurs soms moeilijk informatie krijgen fabrikant warmtepomp. − “Klanten horen vooral v warmtepomp. Sommigen gehoord waterstof. Maar veel. staat kinderschoenen geheimzinnig gedaan. Je produceren. Dan onafhankelijk energiebedrijven. natu urlijk niet, houden tegen.” − “Bij afdeling iedereen geïnteresseerd. Maar merk geheimzinnig gedaan wa rmte pomp. Je identificeren binnen mag. Je kijken leren. denk , ?” − “In begin woningproject kwam , problemen warmtepompen, fabrikant niks vertellen, ondersteuning niet…” − “Je weet eerder gebeurd w armte pomp. Ji j bent nr 12 jij oplossen .” − “De echniek zulke sprongen nemen, moeilijk anticiperen .” 21 6. OPLOSSINGSRICHTINGEN DIE MONT EURS AANDRAGEN In gesprekken steeds gevraagd oplossingsrichtingen monteurs energie transitie bespoedigen denken hieraan bijdrage leveren .

REGUL ATIONS
REGUL ATION (EU) 2023/955 OF THE EUR OPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL 
of 10 May 2023
establishing a Social Climate Fund and amending Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 
THE EUR OPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUR OPEAN UNION,
Havi ng regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 91(1), point (d), 
Article 192(1) and Article 194(2), and Article 322(1), point (a), thereof,
Havi ng regar d to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draf t legislative act to the national parliaments,
Havi ng regar d to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
Havi ng regar d to the opinion of the Committ ee of the Regions (2),
Acting in accordance with the ordinar y legislative procedure (3),
Whereas:
(1) The Paris Agreement (4), adop ted on 12 December 2015 under the United Nations Framew ork Convention on 
Climate Change (UNFCCC) (the ‘Paris Agreement’), entered into force on 4 November 2016 . The Parties to the Paris 
Agreement have agreed to hold the increase in the global average temperature well below 2 °C abov e pre-industr ial 
levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1,5 °C abov e pre-industr ial levels. That commitment 
has been reinf orced with the adoptio n under the UNFCCC of the Glasgow Climate Pact on 13 Novem ber 2021 , in 
which the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCC, serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement, 
recognises that the impa cts of climat e change will be much lower at a temperature increase of 1,5 °C, compar ed 
with 2 °C, and resolves to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1,5 °C.
(2) The communication of the Commission of 11 December 2019 on ‘The European Green Deal’ (the ‘European Green 
Deal’) sets out a new growth strateg y that aims to transf orm the Union into a sustainable, fair and prosperous society , 
with a moder n, resource-effi cient and competitive econom y, where there are no net emissions of greenhouse gases at 
the latest by 2050 and where economic growth is decoupled from resource use. The European Green Deal also aims 
to restore, protect, conser ve and enhance the Union’s natural capital, and protect the health and well-being of 
citizens from environment-relat ed risks and impacts. Finally , it considers that this transition should be just and 
inclusive, leav ing no one behind.
(1)OJ C 152, 6.4.2022, p. 158.
(2)OJ C 301, 5.8.2022, p. 70.
(3)Position of the European Parliament of 18 Apr il 2023 (not yet published in the Official Jour nal) and decision of the Council of 
25 Apr il 2023.
(4)OJ L 282, 19.10.2016, p. 4.EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union 16.5.2023 L 130/1  (3) Through the adop tion of Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5), the Union 
has enshr ined in legislation the objective of economy-wide climat e neutrality by 2050 at the latest, and the aim of 
achi eving negative emissions thereaf ter. That Regulation also establishes a binding Union domestic reduction target 
for net greenhouse gas emissions (emissions after deduction of removals) of at least 55 % compar ed to 1990 levels 
by 2030. All sectors of the economy are expected to contr ibute to achieving that targe t.
(4) The conclusions of the European Council of 10-11 December 2020 endorsed the binding Union domestic reduction 
target for net greenhouse gas emissions, while underlining the impor tance of considerations of fairn ess and 
solidar ity and leav ing no one behind. Those conclusions were reaffir med in the conclusions of the European 
Council of 24-25 May 2021 , when the European Council invit ed the Commission to swif tly put forward its 
legislative packag e together with an in-depth examination of the environmental, economic and social impact at 
Member State level.
(5) The European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan, endorsed by the conclusions of the European Council of 24-
25 June 2021 , highlights the need to strengthen social rights and the European social dimension across all policies 
of the Union. Principle 20 of the European Pillar of Social Rights states that ‘ever yone has the right to access 
essential services of good quality , including water , sanitation, energy , transpor t, financial services and digital 
communications. Suppor t for access to such services shall be available for those in need.’.
(6) The Porto Declaration of 8 May 2021 reaffir med the European Council’s pledge to work towards a social Europe 
strengthening a fair transition and its determination to continue deepening the implementation of the European 
Pillar of Social Rights at Union and national level, with due regar d for respective compet ences and the principles of 
subsidiar ity and propor tionality .
(7) In order to implement the commitment towards climate neutrality , the Union’s climat e and energy legislation has 
been reviewed and amended in order to accelerate greenhouse gas emission reductions.
(8) Those amendments have differi ng economic and social impacts on the differ ent sector s of the econom y, citizens and 
Member States. In particular , the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions from buildings, road transpor t and 
additional sectors which correspond to industr ial activities not covered by Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC of the 
European Parliament and of the Council (6)within the scope of that Directive should provide an additional 
economic incentive to invest in the reduction of fossil fuel consum ption and thereb y accelerat e the reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions. Combined with other measures, this should, in the medium to long term , contr ibute to 
the reduction of energy poverty and transpor t pover ty, reduce the costs of buildings and road transpor t, and, where 
relevant, provide new oppor tunities for quality job creation and sustainable investments, fully aligned with the goals 
of the European Green Deal.
(9) However , resources are needed to finance those inve stments. In addition, before such investments are made, the cost 
suppor ted by households and transpor t users for heating, cooling, cooking, and road transpor t, is likely to increase 
as fuel suppliers that are subject to the obligations under the emission trading system for buildings and road 
transpor t pass on the costs of carbon to consumers.
(10) The climate transition will have an economic and social impact that is difficult to assess ex ante. Achieving the 
increased climat e ambition will require substantial public and private resources. Investments in energy efficiency 
measures, as well as renewable energy-based heating system s, such as heating with electr ic heat pumps, heating and 
cooling at distr ict level and participation in renewable energy communities, are an effective method of reducing 
imp ort dependency and emissions while increasing the Union’s resilience. Dedicat ed funding to suppor t vulnerable 
households, vulnerable micro-ent erprises and vulnerable transpor t users is necessar y.
(5)Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 June 2021 establishing the framewo rk for achieving 
climate neutrality and amending Regulations (EC) No 401/2009 and (EU) 2018/1999 (‘European Climate Law’) (OJ L 243, 9.7.2021, 
p. 1).
(6)Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a system for greenhouse gas 
emission allowance trading within the Union and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC (OJ L 275, 25.10.2003, p. 32).EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union L 130/2 16.5.2023  (11) The increase in the price for fossil fuels can dispropor tionally affect vulnerable households, vulnerable micro- 
enterprises and vulnerable transpor t users who spend a larger part of their income on energy and transpor t, who, 
in certain regions, do not have access to alternative, affordable mobility and transpor t solutions, and who may lack 
the financial capacity to invest in the reduction of fossil fuel consum ption. Geographic specificities, such as islands, 
outermost regions and territori es, rural or remot e areas, less accessible peripher ies, mountainous areas or areas that 
are lagging behind, can have specifi c impacts in the cont ext of transpor t poverty on the vulnerability of households, 
micro-ent erprises and transpor t users. Theref ore, those geographic specificities should be taken into account when 
prepar ing measures and investments in suppor t of vulnerable households, vulnerable micro-ent erprises and 
vulnerable transpor t users, where applicable and relevant.
(12) A part of the revenues generated by the inclusion of buildings, road transpor t and additional sectors within the scope 
of Directive 2003/87/EC should be used to address the social impacts arising from that inclusion, in order for the 
transition to be just and inclusive, leav ing no one behind. The overall amount of the Social Climate Fund established 
under this Regulation (the ‘Fund’) should reflect the level of decarbonisation ambition from the inclusion of 
greenhouse gas emissions from buildings, road transpor t and additional sector s within the scope of 
Directive 2003/87/EC.
(13) Using part of the revenues to address the social impacts arising from the inclusion of the buildings, road transpor t 
and additional sector s within the scope of Directive 2003/87/EC is even more relevant in view of the existing levels 
of energy poverty. Energy poverty is a situation in which households are unable to access essential energy services 
that under pin a decent standard of living and health, such as adequate warmth through heating, cooling, as 
temperatures rise, lighting, and energy to power appliances. In a 2021 Union-wide survey, appro ximately 34 
million Europeans, nearly 6,9 % of the population of the Union, said that they could not afford to heat their home 
suffi ciently . Energy poverty is theref ore a major challenge for the Union. While social tariffs or temporar y direct 
income suppor t can provid e immediate relief to households facing energy poverty in the shor t term , only targe ted 
structural measures, in particular building renov ations, including through access to energy from renewable sources 
and the active promotion of renewable energy sources through information and awareness-raising measures 
target ed at households, and building renova tions that contr ibut e to the objectives established in 
Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (7)can provi de lasting solutions and 
effectively help combat energy poverty. It should be possible for the definition of energy pover ty under this 
Regulation to be updated to reflect the outcome of the negotiations on a Directive of the European Parliament and 
of the Council on energy efficiency (recast).
(14) A holistic approach to building renov ations that take s into account in a more effic ient way people at risk of 
excl usion, namely those who suffer most from energy pover ty in the Union, could lead to less demand for energy . 
Theref ore, the suppor t under the Fund to the buildings sector should aim to impro ve energy efficiency , leading to a 
reduction in energy consump tion for each household that would be visible in terms of the money saved and, as a 
result, would provide one means of combating energy poverty. The revision of Directive 2010/31/EU would lay the 
foundations for those objectives to be achi eved and should theref ore be taken into account when implementing this 
Regulation.
(15) Since transpor t poverty has not yet been defined at Union level, such a definition should be introduced for the 
purpose of this Regulation. Transpor t poverty could become an even more pressing issue, as recognised in the 
Council Recommendation of 16 June 2022 on ensur ing a fair transition towards climat e neutrality (8), and result in 
diminished access to essential socioeconomic activities and services such as employment, education or healthcare, 
in particular for vulnerable individuals and households. Transpor t pover ty is usually caused by one or a 
combination of factors such as low income, high fuel expenditures, or a lack of affordable or accessible private or 
public transpor t. Transpor t poverty can particularly affect individuals and households in rural, insular , peripheral, 
mountainous, remot e and less accessible areas or less developed regions or territories, including less developed peri- 
urban areas and the outermost regions.
(7)Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 2010 on the energy performance of buildings 
(OJ L 153, 18.6.2010, p. 13).
(8)OJ C 243, 27.6.2022, p. 35.EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union 16.5.2023 L 130/3  (16) The Fund should be established to provide funds to the Member States to suppor t their policies to address the social 
imp acts of the introduction of the emissions trading system for buildings and road transpor t on vulnerable 
households, vulnerable micro-ent erprises and vulnerable transpor t users. This should be achi eved in particular 
through temporar y direct income suppor t and measures and inve stments intended to reduce reliance on fossil fuels 
through increased energy efficiency of buildings, decarbonisation of heating and cooling of buildings, irrespective of 
who owns those buildings, including the integrat ion of energy from renewable sources, and through granting 
imp roved access to zero- and low-emission mobility and transpor t to the benefit of vulnerable households, 
vulnerable micro-ent erprises and vulnerable transpor t users. Attention needs to be paid to the differ ent forms of 
rental housing, including those on the private rental market. Financial suppor t or fiscal incentives, such as 
deductibility of renov ation costs from the rent could be included among the measures in order to take account of 
tenants and people living in social housing.
(17) Each Member State should submit to the Commission a Social Climate Plan (the ‘Plan’). The Plans should be 
submitted by 30 June 2025 so that they can be given careful and timely consideration. The Plans should have an 
inve stment compo nent that promotes the long-t erm solution of reducing fossil fuels reliance and could envisag e 
other measures, including temporar y direct income suppor t, to mitig ate adverse effects on income in the shor ter 
term . The Plans should pursue two objectives. First, they should provide vulnerable households, vulnerable micro- 
enterprises and vulnerable transpor t users with the necessar y resources to finance and carry out investments in 
energy efficiency , decarbonisation of heating and cooling, in zero- and low-emission vehicles and mobility , 
including through vouchers, subsidies or zero-int erest loans. Second, they should mitig ate the impact of the 
increase in the cost of fossil fuels on the most vulnerable and thereby prevent energy pover ty and transpor t pover ty 
during the transitional period until such inve stments have been carried out. The Plans could suppor t access to 
affordable energy-efficient housing, including social housing. When imple menting measures in suppor t of 
vulnerable transpor t users, it should be possible for Member States to prioritise suppor t to zero-emission vehicles in 
their Plans, provi ded that it is an affordable and deplo yable solution.
(18) Member States, in consultation with local and regional author ities, economic and social partners and relevant civil 
society organisations, are best placed to design, implement and, where relevant, amend Plans that are adapt ed and 
target ed to their local, regional and national circumstances, their existing policies in the relevant areas and planned 
use of other relevant Union funds. A public consultation of stak eholders should take place ever y time the 
Commission is required to assess a Plan. In that manner , the broad diversity of situations, the specific kno wledge of 
local and regional governments, economic and social partners, relevant civil society orga nisations, researc h and 
innovati on institutions, industr ial stak eholders and social dialogue representatives, as well as national circumstances 
can best be reflected and contr ibut e to the effectiveness and efficiency of the overall suppor t to the vulnerable.
(19) The Plans should be designed in close cooperation with the Commission and prepared in accordance with the 
template provid ed. In order to avoid excessiv e administrative burdens, it should be possible for Member States to 
make minor adjustments to or correct clerical errors in the Plans, by a simple notification of those change s to the 
Commission. Minor adjustments should represent an increase or decrease of less than 5 % of a targe t envisaged in 
the Plan.
(20) Ensur ing that the measures and investments are particularly targe ted towards households in energy pover ty or 
vulnerable households, vulnerable micro-ent erprises and vulnerable transpor t users is key for a just transition 
towards climat e neutrality . Suppor t measures to promot e reductions in greenhouse gas emissions should help 
Member State s to address the social impacts arising from the emissions trading in the buildings and road transpor t 
sector s.
(21) Pending the impact of those inve stments on reducing costs and emissions, well target ed direct income suppor t for 
vulnerable households and vulnerable transpor t users would contr ibute to a reduction of energy and mobility costs 
and would suppor t the just transition. Direct income suppor t should be underst ood to be a temporar y measure 
accompan ying the decarbonisation of the housing and transpor t sector s. It would not be permanent as it does not 
address the root causes of energy poverty and transpor t poverty. Such suppor t should only be used to address direct 
imp acts of the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions from buildings and road transpor t within the scope of 
Directive 2003/87/EC, and should not be used to address electr icity or heating costs related to the inclusion of 
power and heat production in the scope of that Directive. Eligibility for such direct income suppor t should be 
limited in time. Recipients of direct income suppor t should be target ed, as members of a general group of 
recipients, by measures and investments aimed at effectively lifting those recipients out of energy pover ty and EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union L 130/4 16.5.2023  transpor t poverty. The Plans should theref ore include direct income suppor t provi ded that they also contain 
measures or investments with lasting impa cts targe ted at the vulnerable households and vulnerable transpor t users 
who receive direct income suppor t.
(22) Member State s should raise awareness among vulnerable households, vulnerable micro-ent erprises and vulnerable 
transpor t users by providing target ed, accessible and affordable information, education and advice on cost-eff ective 
measures and investments, and available suppor t, including through energy audits of buildings, as well as tailored 
energy consultations or tailored mobility management services.
(23) Taking into account the imp ortance of tackling climat e chang e in accordance with the Paris Agreement 
commitments, and the commitment to the Unit ed Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the measures and 
inve stments under this Regulation are intende d to be in line with the targe t that at least 30 % of the total amount of 
the Union budget under the multiannual financial framework for the years 2021 to 2027 laid down in Council 
Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2093 (9)(the ‘MFF 2021-2027’) and of the total amount of the European Union 
Recove ry Instr ument, established by Council Regulation (EU) 2020/2094 (10), and at least 37 % of the total amount 
of the Recov ery and Resilience Facili ty, established by Regulation (EU) 2021/241 of the European Parliament and of 
the Council (11), should be spent on mainstreaming climat e objectives. The measures and investments under this 
Regulation are also intended to be in line with the ambition of providing 7,5 % of annual spending under the MFF 
2021-2027 to biodiversity objectives in 2024 and 10 % of annual spending under MFF 2021-2027 to biodiversity 
objectives in 2026 and 2027, while consider ing the existing overlaps between climat e and biodiversity goals.
For that purpose, the methodology set out in Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 of the European Parliament 
and of the Council (12)should be used to track the expenditures of the Fund. The Fund should suppor t measures and 
inve stments that fully respect climate and environmental standards and priorities of the Union and comply with the 
principle of ‘do no signif icant harm’ within the meaning of Article 17 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European 
Parliament and of the Council (13). Only such measures and investments should be included in the Plans. Direct 
income suppor t measures should, as a rule, be considered as having an insignificant foreseeable impact on 
environmental objectives and, as such, should be considered to be compl iant with the principle of ‘do no significant 
harm’. The Commission should issue technical guidance to the Member States well ahead of the preparation of the 
Plans. The guidance should explain how the measures and investments are to compl y with the principle of ‘do no 
signif icant harm’.
(24) Women are dispropor tionately affected by energy poverty and transpor t poverty, in particular sing le mothers, who 
represent 85 % of sing le parent famili es, as well as sing le women, women with disabilities, and elderly women living 
alone. In addition, women have differ ent and more compl ex mobility patte rns. Sing le parent famili es with dependent 
children have a particularly high risk of child poverty. Gender equality and equal oppor tunities for all, and the 
mainstreaming of those objectives, as well as accessibility rights of persons with disabilities should be upheld and 
promote d throughout the preparation and implementation of Plans to ensure that no one is left behind.
(25) Active customer s, citizen energy communities and peer -to-peer trading of renewable energy can help Member States 
achi eve the objectives of this Regulation through a bottom-up approac h initiated by citizens. They empo wer and 
engag e consumers and enable certain groups of household customers to participate in energy efficiency measures 
and investments, suppor t the use of renewable energy of households and at the same time contr ibut e to figh ting 
energy poverty. Member State s should theref ore promote the role of citizen energy communities and renewable 
energy communities and regard them as eligible beneficiar ies of the Fund.
(9)Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2093 of 17 December 2020 laying down the multiannual financial framewo rk for the years 
2021 to 2027 (OJ L 433 I, 22.12.2020, p. 11).

p. 159).
(13)Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to 
facilitat e sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (OJ L 198, 22.6.2020, p. 13).EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union 16.5.2023 L 130/5  (26) Member States should include in the Plans the measures and investments to be financed, the estimat ed costs of those 
measures and investments, and the national contr ibution. When submitting their Plans, Member States should 
present the estimate d total costs excluding the value added tax (VAT) to enable comparability between the Plans. 
The Plans should also include key milestones and targets so that the effective implementation of the measures and 
inve stments can be assessed.
(27) The Fund and the Plans should be coherent with and framed by the reforms planned and the commitments made by 
the Member State s under their updat ed integra ted national energy and climate plans in accordance with Regulation 
(EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council (14), under Directive of the European Parliament 
and the Council on energy efficiency (recast), under the European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan, under 
cohesion policy programmes in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2021/1060, under territori al just transition plans 
in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2021/1056 of the European Parliament and of the Council (15), under reco very 
and resilience plans in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2021/241, under the Moder nisation Fund, as set out in 
Article 10d of Directive 2003/87/EC, and under the Member State s’ long-t erm building renov ation strateg ies in 
accordance with Directive 2010/31/EU. To ensure administrative efficiency , where applicable, the information 
included in the Plans should be consiste nt with those legislative acts and plans.
(28) For more efficient planning, Member State s should indicate in their Plans the consequences of postponing the 
emission trading syste m established in accordance with Chapt er IVa of Directive 2003/87/EC, pursuant to 
Article 30k of that Directive. To that end, all the relevant information to be included in the Plan should be 
thoroughly distinguished by separating it into two scenar ios, namely , by descr ibing and quantifying the necessar y 
adjustments to the measures, investments, milestone s, targets, the amount of national contr ibution and any other 
relevant element of the Plan.
(29) The Union should suppor t Member State s with financia l means to implement their Plans through the Fund. 
Payments from the Fund should be made conditional upon the achieve ment of the milestones and targets included 
in the Plans. This would enable national circumstances and priorities to be taken into account, while simplifying 
financing and facilitating the integration of financing under the Fund with other national spending programmes 
and while guaranteeing the impact and the integrity of Union spending.
(30) The Fund should be excep tionally and temporar ily financed by the revenue generated from the auctioning of 50 
million allowances pursuant to Article 10a(8b) of Directive 2003/87/EC, 150 million allowances pursuant to 
Article 30d(3) of that Directive and a volume of additional allowances pursuant to Article 30d(4) of that Directive, 
which should constitute external assigned revenue. In principle, a maximum amount of EUR 65 000 000 000
should be made available for the implementation of the Fund for the period 2026-2032. The Commission is to 
ensure the auctioning of allowances covered by Chapt er IVa of that Directive. Where the emission trading system 
established in accordance with that Chapt er is postponed until 2028 pursuant to Article 30k of that Directive, the 
maximum amount available for the implementation of the Fund should be EUR 54 600 000 000 . That amount and 
the annual amounts reflect a greater need of financing at the start of the Fund. The maximum financial allocation 
should be calculat ed for each Member State in accordance with an allocation methodology providing, in particular , 
additional suppor t to those Member States that are more impa cted by the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions 
from buildings and road transpor t within the scope of Directive 2003/87/EC. Consider ing that the external 
assigned revenue is to be made available followi ng the auctioning of allowances pursuant to Articles 10a(8b), 
30d(3) and 30d(4) of Directive 2003/87/EC, it is necessar y to provid e for a derogation from Article 22(2) of 
Regulation (EU, Euratom ) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council (16)to enable the Union to 
commit each year the amounts necessar y for the payments to Member State s to be made in accordance with this 
Regulation for the accommodation of appropr iations corresponding to assigned revenue.

and repealing Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 (OJ L 193, 30.7.2018, p. 1).EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union L 130/6 16.5.2023  (31) Member States should contr ibut e at least 25 % of the estimat ed total costs of their Plans.
(32) The budget ary commitments should be able to be broke n down into annual instalments, where appropr iate. The 
agreements with Member States constituting individual legal commitments should take into account, inter alia, the 
event refer red to in Article 30k of Directive 2003/87/EC whic h could trigge r a one year dela y of the start of 
emissions trading for buildings, road transpor t and additional sector s. Those agreements should also take into 
account any potential financial risks for the Union, whic h might require an amendment of the individual legal 
commitments, due to the specificities of the temporar y and excep tional financing of the Fund by exte rnal assigned 
revenue generat ed from allowances of the emission trading system .
(33) In order to ensure additional resources for the Fund, the Member States should be able to request a transfer of 
resources to the Fund from the cohesion policy programmes under shared management , established by Regulation 
(EU) 2021/1060, subject to the conditions set out in that Regulation. In order to provi de Member States with 
suffi cient flexibility in the implementation of their allocations under the Fund, it should be possible to transfer 
resources from their annual financial allocation to funds under shared manage ment provid ed for in Regulation 
(EU) 2021/1060, up to a ceiling of 15 %. With a view to alleviating the administrative burden resulting from 
successive transfer s of resources from their annual financial allocation from the Fund to funds under shared 
manage ment falling within the scope of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060, the corresponding amendment of one or 
more programmes should, in principle, be required only once, subject to certain conditions to ensure effective 
financial control. It should be possible to effect further transfers in subsequent years by notifying the financial tables 
to the Commission, provi ded that the chang es relate exclusively to an increase in the financial resources, without any 
further changes to the programme concer ned.
(34) The Fund should suppor t measures that respect the principle of additionality of Union funding. The Fund should not 
be a substitute for recur ring national expenditure, excep t in duly justified cases, including for payments of costs for 
technical assistance actions indicated in the Plans.
(35) In order to ensure the efficient, transparent and coherent allocation of funds, and to respect the principle of sound 
financial management , actions under this Regulation should be consistent with and be complementary to ongoing 
Union, national and, where appropr iate, regional programmes, whilst avoiding double funding from the Fund and 
other Union programmes for the same expenditure. In particular , the Commission and Member States should 
ensure effective coordination, at all stages of the process, in order to safeg uard the consiste ncy, coherence, 
compl ementar ity and synergy among sources of funding. To that effect, Member States should be required to 
present the relevant information on existing or planned Union financing when submitting their Plans to the 
Commission. Financial suppor t under the Fund should be additional to the suppor t provid ed under other Union 
programmes and instr uments. Measures and investments financed under the Fund should be able to receive funding 
from other Union programmes and instr uments provi ded that such suppor t does not cover the same costs.
(36) Payments should be made on the basis of a Commission decision author ising the disbursement to the Member State 
concer ned. It is theref ore necessar y to derogat e from Article 116(2) of Regulation (EU, Euratom ) 2018/1046, so that 
the payment deadline can start running from the date of the communication from the Commission to the Member 
State concer ned of that decision and not from the date on which a payment request is received.
(37) After the analysis of all the payment requests received in a given round, and if revenues assigned to the Fund in 
accordance with Article 30d(4) of Directive 2003/87/EC are not suffi cient to cover the payment requests submitte d 
by the Member States, the Commission should pay the Member States on a pro rata basis in order to provid e for an 
equal treatment of Member States. In the followi ng round of payment requests, the Commission should give priority 
to those Member State s with dela yed payments from the previous round of payment requests, and only afterwards 
pay the newly submitt ed payment requests.
(38) In order to facilitat e the preparation of the Plans and to ensure transparent rules for monitori ng and evaluation, the 
list of common indicators and the template for the Plans should be included in the Annexes to this Regulation. It 
should be possible for the Member States to use relevant common indicators to set out the mileston es and targe ts in 
their Plans. The list of common indicator s should contain the common indicators for repor ting on the progress and 
for the purpose of monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the Plans and of the Fund.EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union 16.5.2023 L 130/7  (39) The Fund should be implemented in line with the principle of sound financial management, including the effective 
prevention and prosecution of fraud, tax fraud, tax evasion, corruption and conf licts of inter ests. The Fund is 
subject to a general regime of conditionality for the prot ection of the Union budget in the case of breaches of the 
principles of the rule of law in the Member State s established by Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2092 of the 
European Parliament and of the Council (17).
(40) For the purpose of sound financial management , while respecting the performa nce-based nature of the Fund, 
specifi c rules should be laid down for budget commitments, payments, suspension, and the recovery of funds as 
well as for the term ination of agreements related to financial suppor t. The Member States should take appropr iate 
measures to ensure that the use of funds in relation to measures suppor ted by the Fund compl ies with applicable 
Union and national law. Member State s should ensure that such suppor t is granted in compliance with the Union 
State aid rules, where applicable. In particular , they should ensure that fraud, corruption and conf licts of interests 
are prevente d, detec ted and corrected, and that double funding from the Fund and other Union programmes is 
avoided. Suspension and the term ination of agreements relat ed to financia l suppor t, as well as reduction and 
recovery of the financial allocation, should be possible when the Plan has not been imp lemented in a satisf actory 
manner by the Member State concer ned or in the case of serious irregular ities, namely fraud, corruption and 
conf licts of inter ests in relation to the measures suppor ted by the Fund or a serious breach of an oblig ation under 
the agreements related to financial suppor t. In the case of the term ination of an agreement related to financial 
suppor t or the reduction and reco very of a financial allocation, those amounts should be allocated to Member 
State s by 31 December 2033 according to the rules for distr ibution of allowances set out in Article 30d(5) of 
Directive 2003/87/EC. Appropr iate contradicto ry procedures should be established to ensure that the decisions of 
the Commission in relation to suspension and reco very of amounts paid or the term ination of agreements related to 
financial suppor t respect the right of Member States to submit obser vations.
(41) The Commission should ensure that the financial interests of the Union are protect ed effectively . While it is primar ily 
the responsibility of the Member State itself to ensure that the Fund is implement ed in compl iance with relevant 
Union and national law, the Commission should be able to receive sufficient assurance from Member State s in that 
regard. To that end, in implementing the Fund, Member States should ensure the functioning of an effective and 
efficient intern al control system and should reco ver amounts unduly paid or misused. In that regar d, Member States 
should be able to rely on their regular national budget management systems . Member States should collect, record 
and store in an electronic system, standardised cate gories of data and information allowing the prevention, 
detection and correction of serious irregular ities in relation to the measures and inve stments suppor ted by the 
Fund, namely fraud, corruption and conf licts of inter ests. The Commission should mak e available an information 
and monitori ng syste m, including a sing le data-mining and risk-scor ing tool, to access and analyse that data and 
information. The Commission should encourage the use of that information and monitor ing syste m with a view to 
a generalised application by Member States.
(42) The Commission, the European Anti-Fraud Offi ce (OLAF), the Cour t of Audit ors and, where applicable, the 
European Public Prosecut or’s Offi ce (EPPO) should be able to use the information and monitori ng system within 
their compet ences and rights.
(43) The Member States and the Commission should be allowed to process personal data only where necessar y for the 
purpose of ensur ing disc harge, audit and control, information, communication and visibility of the use of funds in 
relation to measures for the imp lementation under the Fund. Personal data should be processed in accordance with

propor tionat e measures, including measures relating to the prevention, detec tion, correction and inve stigation of 
fraud, corrupti on and conf licts of interests, and, where appropr iate, the imposition of administrative penalties. In 
particular , in accordance with Regulations (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 and (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013, OLAF has 
the power to carry out administrative investigat ions, including on-the-spot checks and inspections, with a view to 
establishing whether there has been fraud, corruption, conf licts of interests or any other illegal activity affect ing the 
financial interests of the Union.
EPPO is empo wered, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, to investig ate and prosecut e fraud, corruption,

The methodology takes into account the follo wing variables with regard to each Member State:
— population at risk of pover ty living in rural areas (2019);
— carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion by households (2016-2018 average);
— the percentage of households at risk of poverty with arrears on their utility bills (2019);
— total population (2019);
— the Member State’s gross national income (GNI) per capita, measured in purchas ing power standard (2019);
— the share of reference emissions under Article 4(2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/842 for the emission sources 1A3b, 1A4a 
and 1A4b, as established in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventor ies (2016-2018 average), 
as comprehensively reviewed pursuant to Article 4(3) of that Regulation.
The maximum financia l allocation of a Member State under the Fund (MFAi) is established as follo ws:

  2 Managementsamenvatting  
In dit onderzoek zijn verschillende focusgroep gesprekken georganiseerd om meer inzicht te krijgen in de 
rol die medewerke rs van bouwmarkten en doe -het-zelf zaken (kunnen) spelen in de energietransitie. 
Medewerkers hebben direct contact met eigenaren en huurders van woningen die verduurzaamd moeten 
worden. Het advies dat medewerkers geven, of wat te vinden is op de website, k an een grote invloed 
uitoefenen op de uiteindelijke beslissing van de consument.  
 
In de focusgroep gesprekken is aan de ene kant gekeken naar de klantgesprekken  die medewerkers 
hebben: Welke triggers en drempels zien medewerkers bij klanten die hun woning  willen verduurzamen?  
 
Volgens de medewerkers waren d e belangrijkste triggers  voor klanten  om hun woning te verduurzamen:  
• Financiële triggers : Medewerkers gaven aan dat verduurzaming van de woning door klanten 
voornamelijk financieel gedreven  is. Denk hierbij aan het besparen van energiekosten, vouchers 
vanuit gemeentes (vooral voor kleine verduurzamingsmaatregelen zoals radiatorfolie en led 
lamp en) en subsidies (voornamelijk voor grote verduurzamingsmaatregelen zoals isolatie).  
• De zichtbaarheid van producten en hun impact , zoals een 3D -showmodel in de winkel  of een 
warmtescan van de woning , is een andere trigger en werd ook genoemd als aanleidin g voor een 
klantgesprek . 
• De (sociale ) omgeving  van de klant , zoals buren of familie , maar ook informatie vanuit de media, 
bedrijven of de overheid heeft invloed op keuzes van de klant om te verduurzamen . 
• Daarnaast  zien medewerkers dat er verschil is in interesse voor verduurzaming . Zo zijn 
woningeigenaren over het algemeen meer geïnteresseerd in producten zoals isolatie . Huurders 
daarentegen kopen vaker kleine(re) verduurzamingsmaatregelen, zoals radiatorfolie, toc htstrips 
en ledlampen.  
 
De belangrijkste drempels  die medewerkers zien bij klanten op het gebied van woningverduurzaming 
zijn:  
• Hoge(re) kosten  voor duurzame producten ten opzichte van alternatieve producten, maar ook de 
hoge investeringskosten van grote verduurzamingsmaatregelen, zoals isolatie . 
• Gebrek aan kennis  over het n ut en de noodzaak om te verduurzamen, maar ook over het 
uitvoeren van de klus. Daarnaast weten klanten ook niet altijd dat ze een subsidie kunnen 
aanvragen.  
• Het uitzoekwerk door de hoeveelheid informatie over verduurzaming en het uitvoeren van de 
klus, zoals bij isolatie, brengt daarnaast ook een hoop gedoe  voor de klant mee.  
 
Aan de andere kant is gekeken naar  de adviesrol van de medewerkers : Welke vragen stellen klanten ? Wat 
vinden medewerkers van het geven van advies over duurzaamheid ? Welke drempels ervaren zij bij het 
adviseren en wat zijn voor hen kansrijke ideeën om deze advisering  te vergemakkelijken?   
 
De belangrijkste drempels die medewerkers ervar en bij advisering zijn:  
• Gebrek aan inhoudelijke kennis  over het geven van advies over verduurzaming. Voornamelijk de 
vragen van klanten met betrekking tot wat een bepaald product qua kostenbesparing oplevert 
zijn moeilijk te beantwoorden . 
• Advies over duurzaamheidsmaatregelen en -producten is vaak een technisch en theoretisch 
verhaal.  Het overbrengen van kennis  is lastig , met name als het product of de impact van het 
product minder zichtbaar is in de bouwmarkt.  
• Daarnaast geven medewerkers aan dat door d e stijgende energieprijzen en/of kortingsbonnen 
die door gem eente beschikbaar worden gesteld, er een run ontstaat op bepaalde producten. Dit 
resulteert in een tekort aan materialen en producten  in de bouwmarkt.  
 
  
 3 Ook is ter sprake gekomen wat volgens medewerkers kansrijke oplossingen  zijn om hen te ondersteunen 
bij deze adviesrol. Dit resulteerde in de volgende ideeën:  
• Een training voor medewerkers  waarin  zij zowel meer kennis opdoen over duurzame producten 
en hoev eel besparing die opleveren , als over de uitvoering van bepaalde 
verduurzamingsmaatregelen en –producten.  
• Visualisatie van producten en hun impact  door bijvoorbeeld een 3D -showmodel in de winkel , het 
beschikbaar stellen van een warmtescan voor klanten of e en QR -code bij het schap . 
• Ook wordt ondersteuning vanuit de overheid  genoemd , zoals het communiceren van een 
eenduidig verhaal met betrekking tot verduurzaming , een uniforme procedure voor bijvoorbeeld 
kortingsbonnen via gemeentes en het wegnemen van dremp els voor klanten om een subsidie 
aan te vragen.

   5 1 Inleiding en achtergrond  
Dit onderzoek verken t de rol die medewerkers van bouwmarkten en doe -het-zelf zaken (kunnen) spelen 
in de energietransitie. Medewerkers  van bouwmarkten hebben direct contact met de eigenaren en 
huurders van woningen die verduurzaamd  moeten worden. Het advies dat medewerkers van  
bouwmarkten geven, of wat te vinden is op de website, kan een grote invloed uitoefenen op de 
uiteindelijke beslissing van de consument.  
 
Er zijn in samenwerking met drie bouwmarktketens in totaal vier focusgroepen georganiseerd met 
medewerkers met verschillende functies uit verschillende  vestigingen . Het doel was  om inzicht te krijgen 
in de gesprekken die medewerkers in bouwmarkten hebben met klanten over verduurzaming en hoe het 
geven van advies  hierover  mogelijk bevorderd kan worden.  Deze focusgro epen vonden plaats van 
november 2021  tot en met januari 2022 .  
 
Dit project is onderdeel van een traject waarin de directie Klimaat en het Behavioural Insights Team van 
het Ministerie van Economische Zaken en Klimaat in samenwerking met externe partijen ki jken naar de  rol 
van intermediairs  in de energietransitie . Eerder is bijvoorbeeld gekeken naar de rol van  cv-installateurs .1 
Intermediairs hebben vaak direct contact met de consument  op de momenten waarop 
duurzaamheidsbeslissingen genomen worden . Door hun expertise en adviesrol hebben zij een 
belangrijke invloed op de beslissingen van de consument. Aan de hand van  focusgroepen willen we 
achterhalen hoe intermediairs ondersteund kunnen  worden in hun rol binnen de klimaattransitie: welke 
factoren (belemmeringen of juist kansen) spelen een rol en hoe kunnen we daar op inspelen?  
 
2 Opzet  
Focusgroepen  
Onder leiding van een ervaren externe gespreksleider zijn er vier (online) focusgroepen georganiseerd 
met elk vier á vijf medewerkers. Middels deze focusgroepen is verkend hoe medewerkers in 
bouwmarkten te werk gaan bij klantgesprekken en hoe zij ondersteund kunnen worden bij het geven van 
advies over verduurzaming:  
➢ Wat voor vra gen krijgen medewerkers van klanten over verduurzaming?  
➢ Welke triggers en barri ères zien bouwmarktmedewerkers bij klanten om te verduurzamen?   
➢ Nemen medewerkers duurzaamheidsaspecten mee in hun advies aan klanten?  
➢ Hoe vinden medewerkers het om te advisere n over duurzaamheid?  
➢ Op welke informatie baseren zij hun advies?  
➢ Hoe kan het geven van advies eventueel vergemakkelijkt worden?   
 
Deelnemers  
Aan de focusgroepen hebben 17 medewerkers van verschillende functies en vestigingen  van drie 
verschillende bouwmarktketens deelgenomen. De functies liepen uiteen  van winkelmedewerker , tot 
(assistent) bedrijfsleider , tot winkelmanager. Het aantal jaar werkervaring  binnen de desbetreffende 
bouwmarktketen verschilde van minder dan 1 jaar tot meer dan 20 jaar.  
 
Werving en r epresentativiteit  
Middels een oproep van de stuurgroep  Doe het Zelf Doe het Duurzaam zijn contactpersonen benaderd 
die zich binnen verschillende bouwmarktketens bezighouden met duurzaamheid . De medewerkers  die 
hebben deelgenomen aan de focusgroepen zijn geworven via deze contactpersonen . Van de 
verschillende vestigingen die we gesproken  hebben,  waren er vaak één of meerdere medewerkers 
gespecialiseerd in het thema duurzaamheid.  Er wordt dan ook verwacht dat de particip erende 
 
1 Rijksoverheid. (2021). CV monteurs en de energietransitie, 
https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/rapporten/2021/09/24/cv -monteurs -en-de-energietransitie   6 medewerkers bij voorbaat al bovengemiddeld geïnteresseerd zijn in het onderwerp duurzaamheid  en zij 
zijn daarmee niet representatief voor alle bouwmarktmedewerkers .  De aard van dit onderzoek is  
kwalitatief, waarbij aan de hand van open vragen en sp ecifieke interviewtechnieken wordt doorgevraagd 
naar “het waarom” achter de antwoorden. Er kunnen op basis van de resultaten geen harde conclusies 
worden getrokken over hoe vaak meningen voorkomen in de totale  doelgroep.  
 
3 Woningverduurzaming in de context van de bouwmarkt  
Aan het begin van het groepsgesprek is aan de bouwmarktmedewer kers gevraagd wat het eerst in hen 
opkomt bij “verduurzaming van de woning”.  De word cloud hieronder geeft de associaties van 
bouwmarktmedewe rkers met verduurzaming van de woning aan, waarbij de begrippen die groter 
afgebeeld zijn vaker voorkwamen. Bouwmarktmedewerkers denken in eerste instantie aan isolatie en 
energie besparen. Ook komen primair associaties naar boven over het assortiment van duurzame 
producten. Specieke producten die vaak genoemd worden zijn led verlichting, tochtstrips en radiatorfolie . 
Zowel deze kleinere energiebesparende producten  zoals radiatorfolie, tochtstrips en ledlampen, als 
grotere projecten zoals isolatie  kwamen ve elvuldig terug in de gesprekken .  
 
4 Woningverduurzaming door klanten  
4.1 Triggers  voor klanten om te verduurzamen   
Financiële triggers  
In het algemeen zien bouwmarktmedewerkers bij klanten een stijgende interesse om  energie te 
besparen . Er wordt opgemerkt dat isoleren een aantal jaar geleden vaker iets was dat klanten er bij deden 
als ze gingen verbouwen, terwijl het nu vaker een doel op zich is.  
  
 “Afgelopen jaren was het meer als mensen soms wat over hadden om in de woning te stoppen, of 
namen ze het mee als ze gingen verbouwen. Nu is het anders ” 
 
Van de triggers die bouwmarktmedewerkers zien bij klanten om te gaan verduurzamen, kwam met name 
het financiële motief  duidelijk naar voren . De stijgende energieprijzen en de vouchers die gemeenten 
uitgeven werden veelv uldig genomend als directe aanleiding . Medewerkers hebben de indruk dat er 
weinig klanten zijn waarbij het klimaat de belangrijkste reden is om te verduurzamen.  
 
Besparing energi ekosten (door stijgende energieprijzen)  
Van de redenen die bouwmarktmedewerkers zien bij klant en om verduurzamingsmaatregelen te nemen 
staat met stip op nummer 1:  geld besparen. Veel klanten vragen advies over hoeveel zij met een specifiek  
 7 product kunnen besparen  en lijken dan ook vooral geïnteresseerd in duurzame productgroepen waar ze 
financieel voordeel uit kunnen halen.  Bij producten waarbij het duurzaamheidsaspect vooral zit in de 
productie of de eigenschappen van het product, zoals verf en hout, is het moeilijker om mensen te 
bewegen naar de duurzame variant.  
 
“Er zit vast wel iemand tussen die er echt wel mee bezig is [met klimaat , red] maar het overgrote deel heeft 
gewoon met de portemonnee te maken .” 
 
“Ik denk dat dat vooral de productgroepen zijn waar klanten financi eel voordeel uit halen, zoals 
isolatie, waterbesparing en dat soort dingen. Ik denk dat het prijsverschil bijvoorbeeld op duurzame 
verf, ik denk dat dat heel veel lastiger wordt om te verkopen. [..]  Degene die dus voor duurzame ver f 
kiest, heeft daar zelf geen financieel gewin aan . Dat is echt puur de verduurzaming in het product 
hoe het gemaakt is, dus het is gewoon beter voor het milieu , en dat is zijn afweging dan om die verf 
te kopen.“  
 
Daarnaas t is de vraag naar energiebesparen de producten sterk toegenomen door de recent gestegen 
energieprijzen . 
 
“Door de stijgende gasprijzen is de vraag naar isolati e en duurzame producten  enorm in een 
stroomversnelling gekomen .”  
 
“De isolatiebehoefte was er natuurlijk al, maar de huidige gasprijs geeft wel dat laatste schopje. Zo 
van, ga het nu echt doen, want nu heeft het echt zin. Of tenminste nu levert het heel snel geld op. “  
 
 
Vouchers gemeenten  
Sommige gemeentes stellen vouchers van rond de 5 0 Euro beschikbaar aan inwoners om  te besteden 
aan duurzame producten bij bouwmarkten . Medewerkers  omschrijven dat zij een run op bepaalde 
producten in de winkel zien wanneer deze kortingsbonnen zijn uitgegeven . Klanten kopen dan 
voornamelijk kleine energiebesparende maatregelen, zoals led lampen en radiatorfolie .  
 
“Radiatorfolie .. Mensen komen om de  beurt binnen, hee ik krijg subsidie, en vragen waar krijg ik dat 
op [..]. En ze  willen  weten hoe het werkt .”  
 
“Ik denk wel dat het nieuwe mensen over de streep heeft getrokken, maar ik denk ook dat na ar 
aanleiding van de gasprijzen heel veel mensen het gingen doen, wel of geen subsidie. […] Bij 
mensen die minder bedeeld zijn, daar komt het zeker van pas, mensen die het anders uitgesteld 
hadden en nu wel er voor gaan. ”  
 
 
Subsidie  
Hoewel  klanten niet altijd weten welke subsidies zij kunnen aanvragen en hoe zij dit kunnen doen, blijven 
subsidies een belangrijke trigger voor klanten om te verduurzamen. Dit geldt met name voor grote 
energiebesparende maatregelen, zoals het isoleren van de wo ning.   
 
""Als mensen erachter komen dat ze subsidie kunnen krijgen, willen ze het vaak laten doen.”   
 
“Ik denk dat men ook wel eens bang is  voor als ik nou de boot mis. Als ik nou niet isoleer, als ik nou 
geen gebruik maak van de mogelijkheden , moet ik straks zelf meer betalen omdat die subsidiepot 
op is.”  
  8 Zichtbaar  maken   
Volgens medewerkers kan het zien van duurzame producten klanten over de streep halen om producten 
aan te schaffen. Een voorbeeld wat hierbij genoemd werd is een 3D-showmodel  om uit te leggen welke 
materialen er nodig zijn om te isoleren en hoe dit er dan uit komt te zien. Ook het duidelijk zichtbaar 
maken van de noodzaak om te isoleren werkt motiverend. In de gesprekken wordt daarvoor een 
warmtescan genoemd als voorbeeld om v oor klanten te visualiseren hoe goed (of slecht) hun huis 
geïsoleerd is. Dit stimuleert klanten om verduurzamingsproducten aan te schaffen.  
 
“Het verschil tussen een led lamp en een halogeen lamp dat kun je vrij snel laten zien. Als je iets 
laat zien dan wordt dat vaak duidelijker voor de klant. Met isolatie dan moet je gaan vertellen en ze 
zien het niet. Ik denk dat dat een groot verschil maakt. ” 
 
“Zien is overtuigen. Als je ziet hoe het werkt, bijvoorbeeld met de zonnepanelen of 
spouwmuurisolatie, is het  makkelijker om klanten over de streep te trekken.”   
 
 
Invloeden vanuit de (sociale) omgeving  
Bouwmarktmedewerkers zien dat de sociale omgeving  zoals buren of familie  van de klant  van invloed zijn 
op keuzes om te verduurzamen. Ook informatie vanuit de media, bedrijven of de overheid stimuleert 
klanten om hun woning te verduurzamen volgens bouwmarktmedewerkers.  
 
“Ik denk ook wel gewoon het ‘mee willen doen ’, omdat ze het nu gewoon heel veel zien, een trend. 
Dat mensen zeggen de buurvrouw die doet het, dus ik ga het ook doen .” 
 
“Laatst had ik drie buren die all e drie  tegelijk hun vloer via de kruipruimte gingen isoleren .”  
 
“Ik heb niet het idee dat iedereen nou zelf bedacht heeft dat hij zijn spouwmuur gaat isoleren of iets 
dergelijks . [..] Dat dat natuurlijk meer gedreven is gewoon door informatie die van buiten af komt 
en dat ze daardoor getriggerd worden om daadwerkelijk te gaan handelen. ” 
 
 
Interesse in verduurzaming  
Kopers versus huurders  
Bouwmarktmedewerkers merken een duidelijk versch il tussen woning eigenaren  en huurders  in hun 
motivatie om te verduurzamen, dat zien ze met name terug in de productkeuze . Huurders kopen vaker  
kleine(re) verduur zamingsmaatregelen, zoals radiatorfolie, tochtstrips en ledlampen. Woningeigenaren  
daarentegen  zijn over het algemeen meer geinteresseerd in producten  zoals isolatie .   
 
“Huurders willen voornamelijk radiatorfolie omdat dat stookkosten bespaart, bij tochtstrip s geven ze 
aan dat de huurbaas dat moet doen. Er is een groot verschil tussen klanten van koop of 
huurwoningen. ”  
 
“Klanten met een koopwoning willen heel graag isoleren; dat is een stukje eigenbelang .”  
 
 
Leeftijd  
Leeftijd lijkt ook mee te spelen in de bereidheid van klanten om hun woning te verduurzamen. Uit de 
focusgroepen kwam naar voren dat de klanten die geïnteresseerd zijn in duurzaamheid en 
duurzaamheidsmaatregelen en -producten over het algemeen jong er zijn.  
 
“Vaak de jongeren, tot denk ik een jaar of 30, 35. Daarboven zie je toch echt wel het oude gedrag 
terugkomen. “   9  
“Voornamelijk oudere mensen denken dat hun huis al goed geïsoleerd is, en beseffen niet hoeveel je 
ermee kan besparen. ”  
 
 
4.2 Drempels  voor klanten bij verduurzaming   
Medewerkers zien op basis van de gesprekken die ze hebben in de winkel  verschillende drempels bij 
klanten om hun woning  te verduurzamen.  Dat zijn met name  hoge (re) kosten , gebrek  aan kennis  en het 
gedoe dat komt kijken bij het uitzoeken en uitvoeren van verduurzamingsmaatregelen . 
 
Hoge (re) kosten voor duurzame producten  
De hoge(re) kosten van verduurzamingsmaatregelen  worden veelvuldig als drempel genoemd, met name 
de grote investering die nodig is voor woningisol atie. Ook zijn die kosten vaak hoger dan mensen van te 
voren verwachten.  
 
“Als je alles bij elkaar optelt, ben je toch wel een groot bedrag kwijt. Kleine maatregelen zoals 
tochtstrips  helpen wel, maar maken geen grote verschillen. Voor h et echte grote isolatie werk moet 
je toch wel een bedrag ophoesten.”   
 
“Als je gaat isoleren, raad ik klimaatfolie aan wat ook nodig is . Deze moet je vervolgens weer 
aftapen met speciaal tape. Dan laat je ze [de klant en] de rolletjes zien en dan vragen ze of ze het  
ook met duc ttape kunnen doen. Maar dan ben je weer terug bij af. Zo lopen de kosten langzaam 
steeds verder op. Sommige klanten besluiten dan om het alsnog te doen. En anderen niet. ”  
 
Daarnaas t is er een verschil tussen productgroepen. Bij waterbesparende douchekoppen is het 
prijsverschil niet zo groot , waardoor klanten eerder de duurzame optie kopen . Bij (led)lampen 
daarentegen, speelt het prijsverschil wel een rol bij de aankoopbeslissing.  
 
“Bij een waterbesparende douchekop daar zit geen prijsverschil meer in, daar maakt het niet meer uit 
voor een klant of hij iets duurzaams koopt of iets niet duurzaams . [..]Daar zie je ook dat het helpt, [.. ] 
je ziet dat klanten daar dus echt wel op letten o f ze een duurzame douchekop kopen. ” 
 
“Leuk die besparing [de ledlamp], maar die lamp kost zes keer zoveel.”  
 
 
Gebrek aan kennis   
Bouwmarktmedewerkers zien een gebrek aan kennis bij klanten, wat hen ervan weerhoudt om hun 
woning te verduur zamen. Het gaat dan vooral om:  
1) Nut en noodzaa k van verduurzamen : mensen weten niet dat ze hun huis (verder) kunnen 
verduurzamen en wat voor besparing verschillende maatregelen en producten op k unnen  
leveren  
2) Uitvoering van de klus: Mensen weten niet hoe ze  de klus aan moeten pakken of denken het niet 
te kunnen. Dit zorgt ervoor dat mensen zich niet orienteren op verduurzamingsproducten of dat 
ze ondanks interesse niet beginnen aan verduurzamingsmaatregelen omdat ze niet het gevoel 
hebben de klus uit te kunn en voeren (en ze de klus niet kunnen/willen laten doen) .   
 
“Er is ook een stukje onwetendheid en gebrek aan kennis. Voornamelijk oudere mensen denken dat 
hun huis al goed geïsoleerd is, en beseffen niet hoeveel je ermee kan besparen.”  
 
“Sommige klanten w eten niet hoe ze een bepaalde klus moeten doen of denken dat ze het  
 niet zelf kunnen.”   
 10  
“Ik denk dat er ook wel veel mensen zijn die denken dat het voor een simpel iemand gewoon niet te 
doen is. Dat het door een bedrijf gedaan zou moéten worden. [..] Omd at het gewoon nog niet 
bekend is dat zo’n plafond isoleren zelf te doen is. “  
 
 
Subsidie  
Waar subsidie over het algemeen een belangrijke trigger is voor klanten om te verduurzamen, brengt dit 
ook een aantal drempels met zich mee. Zo zijn er klanten die niet weten dat ze gebruik kunnen maken 
van een subsidie of hoe ze dit kunnen aanvragen.  Ook noemen bouwmarktmedewerkers het feit dat 
klanten alleen subsidie krijgen als isolatie maatregelen  word en uitgevoerd door een extern bedrijf , en niet 
als ze de klus z elf uitvoeren . Bouwmarktmedewerkers zien dit als een gemiste kans om klanten te 
stimuleren om te verduurzamen.  
 
“Nee, klanten weten vaak niet dat er een subsidie is. Dit adviseer ik ze vaak.”   
 
“Voor het aanbrengen van isolatie door een extern bedrijf is er subsidie, maar voor het 
isolatiemateriaal zelf niet.”   
 
“Er zijn nogal wat eisen aan verbonden [aan de subsidie, red] . Als je wilt gaan verduurzamen, moet 
je hier aan voldoen, daar aan voldoen. Dat moet je kunnen. Dat is vaak een drempel voo r de 
consument, voor de klant om dat te gaan regelen.”  
 
 
Gedoe   
Uitzoekwerk  
Er is veel informatie op internet te vinden over verschillende producten om een woning te verduurzamen. 
Daarbij moeten klanten veel keuzes maken in het voorbereidingsproces. Dit k an ertoe leiden dat klanten 
door de bomen  het bos  niet meer zien en daardoor maar niet s laten doen aan hun woning.  
 
“Als je een keer op zonnepanelen googled wordt je overspoeld met informatie.”   
 
“Doordat alles op internet te vinden is, zie je ook dat klanten dan keuzestress hebben.”   
 
“Ene kant is het een voordeel dat ze zich op internet kunnen orienteren aan de andere kant staat 
elke leverancier voor zijn eigen product. Dan mag jij klant vertellen welke product het beste is.”  
 
 
Uitvoering van de klus  
Daarnaast brengen sommige verduurzamingsmaatregelen veel gedoe met zich mee. Denk bijvoorbeeld 
aan het isoleren van de vloer, spouwmuur of het dak. Doordat mensen hier tegenop zien, zijn zij minder 
bereid om hun woning te verduurzamen.  
 
“Bij isolatie kunn en klanten nog wel tegen de klus op zien. [..] Als je een plafonnetje wilt isoleren 
ofzo, dat is gewoon een heel gedoe.”  
 
   11 5 Adviesrol van medewerkers  
Tijdens de focusgroepen is er gesproken over hoe duurzaamheid ter sprake komt in de gesprekken met 
klanten en over het adviseren van klanten op het gebied van duurzaamheid . Vragen die hierbij aan bod 
kwamen waren: Wat vinden medewerkers  ervan om advies te geven over duurzaamheid ? Waarop 
baseren zij dit advies? Waar lopen zij tegenaan in het adviseren ? En wat zou hen kunnen helpen bij het 
geven van advies ?  
 
5.1 Vragen van klanten over duurzaamheid   
Klanten komen gericht naar winkel  
Klanten komen vaak gericht naar de winkel en weten al wat ze willen aanpakken  in hun huis , voordat ze 
de bouwmarkt binnenlopen. Duurzaamheid is daarmee meestal niet een onderwerp dat spontaan ter 
sprake komt.  
 
“De klanten die binnenkomen hebben van tevoren al bedacht dat ze iets gaan isoleren. [..] Er komen 
weinig klanten binnen die een boor kopen en dan toevallig per ongeluk in z’n winkelmandje ook 
nog een isolatierol meeneemt. ”  
 
“Mensen weten vaak al waarvoor ze naar de bouwmarkt komen en hebben dit online u itgezocht. 
Vaak is mijn rol daarin bevestigen of het klopt wat de klant heeft uitgezocht en waar nodig 
aanvullend advies geven.”  
 
 
Vragen over producten en besparing  
Vragen van klanten in relatie tot  duurzaamheid gaan vaak over het type materiaal dat ze n odig hebben . 
Dan gaat het over welk materiaal van toepassing is in hun situatie  (welk isolatiemateriaal heb ik nodig ?, 
Wat heb ik nodig voor een schuin dak?) , wat de verschillen zijn tussen producten , en wat ze kunnen 
besparen met bepaalde producten.    
 
“Radiatorfolie wordt bij ons best regelmatig verkocht. We hebben twee soorten liggen en dan 
vragen ze welke is het beste rendement, wat gaat het besparen ? [..] Ja de dikkere geeft de beste 
besparing waarschijnlij k. Dat is echt wel een vraag die veel komt. ”   
 
“De vraag die dan komt, we hebben een x aantal verschillende rollen staan, welke moet ik nou 
hebben voor wat ik wil gaan doen? Moet ik rol A,B,C hebben. Dat is eigenlijk de vraag die het meest 
komt, naast de vraag waar ligt het. ” 
 
“Klanten vragen vaak hoeveel ze met een bepaald product besparen. Een ledlamp is bijvoorbeeld 
zes keer zo duur dan een gewone lamp. Klanten willen wel dat het besparing oplevert, anders 
kopen ze liever een goedkopere lamp.”   
 
 
Advies over alternatieve pro ducten  
Klanten hebben ook vaak online al opgezocht welk product ze nodig hebben en willen bevestiging of dat 
klopt. Medewerkers geven soms advies over welk alternatieve product de klant het beste kan gebruiken.   
 
“Het is vooral belangrijk om klanten goed voor te lichten. Je moet weten wat ze willen doen. Ik heb soms 
ook wel dingen afgeraden om te doen. Bijvoorbeeld als mensen piepschuim willen isoleren, terwijl glaswol 
veel effectiever is.”  
 
“Soms krijg je eigenwijze klanten die online hebben opgezocht ho e het moet, maar wat niet de 
juiste manier is om het te doen.”    12 5.2 Houding tegenover adviesrol  
Het merendeel van de medewerkers gaf aan dat hij/zij affiniteit met het onderwerp duurzaamheid he eft 
en hier graag over adviseert . Daarbij geven ze aan dat duurzaamheid vaak niet een onderwerp is waar de 
klant zelf over begint . Sommige medewerkers beginnen zelf over verduurzaming, anderen vinden dat niet 
gepast.  
 
“Ik ben wel een beetje een groene fanaat (lachend).  Ik vind het wel belangrijk om daar [het mil ieu, 
red] goed mee om te gaan. [..]Als ik daar voor de klant iets aan bij kan dragen dan heel graag. Dat 
is mijn goal.”  
 
“Weinig mensen die voor klimaat eerst komt, ik heb het gevoel dat het initiatief [voor 
duurzaamheid , red] veel bij ons vandaan komt. D uurzame mogelijkheden moeten ter sprake 
gebracht worden.”   
 
“Je bent gewoon bezig met een verkoop adviesgesprek en kan niet meteen over duurzaamheid 
hebben. Als de vraag gesteld wordt of je merkt aan de persoon dat ze daar interesse in hebben dan 
kan je he t altijd ter sprake brengen, maar het is niet first in mind dat ik daar over begin.”  
 
“Je wilt gewoon de wens van de klant vervullen, een product aanbieden waar de klant behoefte aan 
heeft. Dat kan een energiebespa ringsproduct zijn maar als dat niet gewen st is dan ga ik het ook 
niet aanbieden. Ik kan het ter sprake brengen.”  
 
 
Eigen ervaring  
De meerderheid van de medewerkers gaf aan zijn/haar advies te baseren op eigen ervaring en op wat ze 
zelf al in huis aan verduurzaming hebben gedaan. Hoewel  niet iedere medewerker ervaring heeft, was er 
wel consensus over dat het heel goed werkt om eigen ervaringen te delen in een gesprek met de klant. 
Door praktijksituaties te beschrijven wordt het voor de klant concreter  gemaakt  welke stappen ze moeten 
onde rnemen  bij bepaalde maatregelen , wat hen eerder zal overtuigen om zelf ook deze 
verduurzamingsmaatregelen te nemen .  
 
“Het persoonlijke contact met de klant en zeggen dat ik het zelf ook heb, zorgt ervoor dat klanten 
eerder bereid zijn om ook te isoleren.”   
 
“Het werkt wel, bijvoorbeeld met zo’n smart systeem, ik heb mijn hele huis daar mee vol hangen. Ik 
kan aan elke klant al mijn voordelen daar aan vertellen. Dat werkt. Ergens heb ik dan ook het idee 
dat ze dan een beetje denken ‘zij heeft er verstand van , dus dan zal het wel zo zijn ’.”  
 
“Ik heb mijn huis bijvoorbeeld helemaal omgezet naar ledverlichting, dat scheelt toch echt wel aanzienlijk en 
dat kan ik ze ook echt wel vertellen wat je bespaart.”  
 
“Ik woon in de buurt en weet wat voor huizen hier in de  buurt staan. Ik heb zelf mijn huis label A gemaakt. 
Persoonlijk contact maakt dat klant je gelooft, “Ik heb ervaring ermee” werkt altijd. ” 
 
 
Doorverwijzing naar website, filmpje s, of exter ne partij    
Medewerkers geven aan dat ze de bepaalde kennis die zij (nog) niet hebben, bijvoorbeeld de Rd -waarde 
van een product, opzoeken op internet. Daarnaast verwijzen  medewerkers hun klanten ook vaak door 
naar interessante websites en filmpjes waarin verschillend e verduurzaamings maatregelen  of de 
toepassing van bepaalde producten  worden uitgelegd.  
 
  13 “Ik laat vaak onze website zien met filmpjes en uitleg van verschillende maatregelen. Vervolgens 
loop ik met de klant mee naar de producten in de schappen. Dit zijn d an vaak andere producten 
dan waar de klant in eerste instantie aan dacht.”   
 
“De dingen ik meegeef zijn de offertes die we maken. Brochures dat is een beetje anno 2000, 
tegenwoordig staat alles online. [Keten, red] heeft ontiegelijk veel instructiefilmpjes  online staan en 
YouTube  is daar een grote helper in. Daar staat alles op, je kan alles terugvinden. Generatie van nu 
wil dit gewoon visueel voor zich zien.”  
 
“We verwijzen naar de website, daar kan je dus of een aannemer aanschrijven, offerte laten 
opstellen om een bepaalde klus te doen, de klusservice. Of stappenplannen van hoe gebruik je een 
bepaald product nou. Dat is natuurlijk visueel wat makkelijker uit t e leggen dan dat je in de winkel 
je verhaaltje staat te vertellen.  Dus wij gebruiken dat wel regelmatig om daar naar te verwijzen.”  
 
“Op de meeste isolatie staan RH  waarden op. Meestal google ik dan even, dit is zoveel, dit is zoveel..”  
 
Op het moment dat dit niet voldoende is, omdat de klus bijvoorbeeld te complex is of de klant dit niet 
zelf wil/kan uitvoeren, dan verwijzen medewerkers door naar een externe partij zoals een 
uitvoeringsbedrijf of de gemeente.  
 
“Wat ik nog wel eens doe dan advise er ik,  joh neem eens contact op met de gemeente , die hebben een 
duurzaamheidsteam, die komen gratis bij je langs en die brengen een advies uit. Als je dat advies hebt, dan 
kan ik wel kijken wat ik daar bij kan vinden. ”  
 
“Als we merken dat de klant het e cht niet kan wel ja [doorverwijzen naar een uitvoeringspartner , 
red]. Als er echt een gebrek aan kennis is dan moet dat wel”  
 
 
Herkenbaarheid duurzaamheidsspecialist  
Een aantal bouwmarktmedewerkers  draagt  kleding waaraan zij herkend kunnen worden als 
duurzaamheidsspecialist. Zij geven aan dat  dit helpt om klanten te adviseren . Klanten reageren hierdoor 
anders op hen en komen met ander soort vragen dan wanneer zij geen herkenbare kleding dragen.  
 
“Ik merk wel dat ik heel anders word aangesproken wanneer ik een groene blouse draag dan 
wanneer ik een blauwe blouse draag. Ik krijg hele andere gesprekken.”   
 
“Klanten nemen eerder wat van je aan op het gebied van verduurzaming als je herkenbare kleding 
draagt.”   
 
 
Productafdeling of showmo del 
Bij sommige vestigingen is er een afdeling in de winkel waar verduurzamingsproducten worden verkocht 
en/of staat er een 3D-showmodel met een dwarsdoorsnede van een geïsoleerd(e) muur of dak. 
Medewerkers zijn hier erg enthousiast over, omdat dit het makkelijker  maakt  om advies te geven over 
isoleren. Ook kan d it voor bouwmarktmedewerkers een aanleiding zijn om op deze klant af te stappen en 
hun advies aan te bieden.   
 
“In de winkel staat een verduurzamingshuis. Dit zijn doorsnedes van de spouwmuren en het dak. 
Als ik klanten daarnaar zie kijken stap ik erop af om te vragen of ik ze kan helpen.”   
  14 “Bij de zuil kijken medewerkers samen met klanten via een online platform wat ze kunnen doen om 
hun huis te verduurzamen. Je laat de website zien, filmpjes en loopt met de klant mee naar de 
producten.”   
 
 
5.3 Drempels  voor medewerkers bij advisering   
Uit de gesprekken kwam naar voren da t medewerkers ook tegen een  aantal dingen aanlopen als het gaat 
om adviseren over verduurzaming smaatregelen en -producten . Aan de ene kant geven zij aan dat het 
soms lastig is dat zij onvoldoende inhoudelijke kennis hebben en dat het lastig is kennis over te brengen 
aan klanten. Bij isolatie vinden zij het bijvoorbeeld lastig om advies op afstand te geven, omdat dit vaak 
maatwerk is. Daarnaast komt het (mede dankzij de toegenome n vraag) ook steeds vaker voor dat er een 
gebrek a an materiaal en producten is.  
 
Niet de juiste of onvoldoende inhoudelijke kennis  
Een deel van de medewerkers geeft aan het gevoel te hebben niet de juiste en onvoldoende inhoudelijk 
kennis te hebben over het geven van advies over verduurzaming . Enkele mede werkers hebben een 
(online ) training  gevolgd over duurzaamheid . Zij geven aan inhoudelijk wel genoeg van het onderwerp te 
weten, m aar ook voor hen blijken vragen over wat een bepaald product qua kostenbesparing oplevert 
moeilijk te beantwoorden . Vanuit de klant is hier juist wel veel vraag naar . 
 
“Dan vragen ze wat gaat het aan reductie opleveren? Ja , dat is heel lastig te zeggen. Je kan 
natuurlijk een geïsoleerde  voordeur hebben maar geen tochtstrippen , dan sta je nog op nul. Dat is 
wel een lastige. Dat mo et ik wel zeggen, we krijgen heel veel vragen van mensen die zeggen: wat 
zou het helpen, wat zou het helpen? En dat is voor ons is gewoon qua kennis, niet eigenlijk. “  
 
“De basis weet je wel, [..] maar hoe het nou precies werkt. Ja, hoe je het moet plaats en dat wel, 
maar niet wat het nou oplevert, wat is je voordeel ervan? Dus eigenlijk , je kan denk ik 40% van de 
informatie maar geven. We hebben vaak wel de praktische informatie maar niet de financiële 
informatie. [..] Dat is lastig.”  
 
“Bij de radiatorventilatoren, daar staat daadwerkelijk op het pakketje bespaart zoveel procent  op je 
energierekening. Maar dat soort termen staan niet op de isolatierollen. Dus het is een heel 
theoretisch verhaal. Ja, als je isoleert bespaar je. Thats’it. En met het ene bespaar je meer en met 
het andere minder. [ ..] of het nou 1 of 80% is dat is niet leesb aar, niet uit te leggen.”  
 
“Maar die financiele onderbouwing is heel lastig te maken voor medewerkers. Van joh, hoeveel ga ik 
nou extra bezuinigen als ik drie cm dikker isolatie neem. Dat financiele gewin wat ze eraan hebben, 
dat is moeilijk uit te leggen . Waardoor je dus ook het koopgedrag mist.”   
 
“[hoeveel het oplevert] hangt van zoveel factoren af, het hangt ook van de montage methode van 
de klant af, of ie het goed doet, of ie het op de juiste manier doet, of ie de folies op de juiste manier 
verwerkt en behandelt. Isolatie is eigenlijk een heel l astig vak, isoleren is eigenlijk een kunst.  
 
“Als een klant in de winkel komt en vraagt naar een product en in je achterhoofd meeneemt , [..] wat 
voor duurzaam advies kan ik geven. Dan zijn er categorieën waar je het een en ander in kan doen, 
maar er zijn ook zat groepen waar je niet die know how hebt, of waar het niet voor op de lippen 
ligt. Ik dacht aan bijverwarming, dan pak je gewoon het kacheltj e, kijk ik nog niet welke heeft  een 
grotere opbrengst welke heeft een kleinere opbrengst. [..] Dat zou een a dvies erbij kunnen zijn, [..]. 
Daar zou ik me in moeten verdiepen.“  
 
  
 15 Overbrengen van kennis  is lastig  
Naast onvoldoende kennis, geven medewerkers aan dat het overbrengen van kennis lastig  is. Advies over 
duurzaamheidsmaatregelen en -producten is vaak ee n technisch en theoretisch verhaal. Het overbrengen 
van kennis is met name lastig als het product  of de impact van het product minder zichtbaar is in de 
bouwmarkt. Verschillende medewerkers lopen aan tegen het feit dat het verschil tussen bijvoorbeeld 
prod uct x en product y lastig te laten zien is, terwijl klanten wel vaak vragen wat nu precies het verschil is 
tussen producten.  
 
“Het verschil tussen een led lamp en een halogeen lamp dat kun je vrij snel laten zien. Als je iets 
laat zien dan wordt dat vaak d uidelijker voor de klant. Met isolatie dan moet je gaan vertellen en ze 
zien het niet. Ik denk dat dat een groot verschil maakt.”  
 
“Komt een klant bij mij in de winkel, die ziet allemaal pakken isolatie, die ziet balken hout, die ziet 
plafondplaatjes. Maar  ja, je moet van dat hele plan wel iets bedenken dat het één [geheel, red] 
wordt.”   
 
 
Tekort aan materiaal  en producten  
Medewerkers geven aan dat door  het stijgen van de  energieprijzen of wanneer de gemeente 
bijvoorbeeld een kortingsbon heeft verstuurd naar haar inwoners, er een run op bepaalde producten 
ontstaat. Dit resulteert in een tekort aan materiaal en producten . Daarnaast geeft een enkele medewerker 
aan dat het winkelaanbod in de bouwmarkt acherloopt op de materialen die op de markt beschikbaar 
zijn, bijvoorbeeld bij isolatie . Deze zaken maken het lastig er voor medewerkers om advies te geven.   
 
“Ja radiatorfolie, die is op bij ons inmiddels. Het is echt enorm hard gegaan sinds de gasprijs zo  
hard omhoog ging. “  
 
“Sommige leveranciers kunnen op dit moment niet alles meer leveren. Dan ben je in gesprek bezig, 
dan wil je naar een bepaald product toe, dan hebben we het gewoon niet meer, dan moet je weer 
een alternatief gaan zoeken. [..] Schaarste . Dat krijg je ook met de grote aanloop in een keer.”  
 
“Nu is er vanuit de gemeente een voucher om je huis te verdurzamen, voornamelijk ledverlichting, 
radiatorfolie. Veel producten zijn niet aan te slepen in de winkel. Je merkt er komt gelijk een run op.”  
 
“Als ik kijk naar isolatiemateriaal zoals wol, heb je tegenwoordig ook pirplaten, die isoleren veel 
beter, zijn makkelijker te verwerken, je hebt geen mondkapje nodig, geen handschoenen nodig, 
allemaal voors voor klanten. Het is weliswaar wat duurder maar je kan met dunner materiaal 
dezelfde isolatiewaarde halen. [..] Dat zijn wel innovaties die ik niet bij ons terug zie komen.”  
 
   16 6 Kansrijke ideeën om medewerkers te ondersteunen bij advies  
Tijdens de focusgroepen is besproken wat medewerkers zou kunnen  helpen bij het adviseren. Wat 
ontbreekt er nu wat adviseren makkelijker kan maken? De ideeën  die naar voren kwamen, zitten hem 
vooral in het verbeteren van de eigen kennis, en meer informatie en visualisatie  van producten voor 
klanten . Daarnaast is ook gevraagd welke oplossingsrichtingen vanuit de overheid de medewerkers zien 
om de energietransitie te bespoe digen.  
 
Training voor medewerkers over verduurzaming van de woning  
Producten  
Eén van de voornaamste drempels waar medewerkers tegenaan lopen in het adviseren, is gebrek aan de 
juiste kennis. Medewerkers geven aan geholpen te kunnen worden met aanvullende informatie over 
producten voor verduurzaming van de woning. Hierbij gaat het bij voorbeeld  een overzicht van de Rd -
waardes van verschillende producten  of een tool om voor een specifiek product uit te kunnen rekenen 
wat de gemiddelde besparing op energie(kosten) voor de klant is . 
 
“Ik zou wel eens gewoon een lijstje willen zien, als je een deur zonder tochtstrippen en een deur met 
tochtstrippen, [..] wat doet dat met een R -waarde. Een dak wel of niet geïsoleerd, een garagewand 
wel of niet geïsoleerd. Of een deur wel of niet geïsoleerd. Daar eens voors en tegen van te zien. Nu 
moet ik elk e keer maar googelen en maar gokken, dat gaat je zoveel schelen. [..] Dan heb je ook 
een zichtbaar iets, je kan het even laten zien.”  
 
“Wat we nu doen is nog teveel vanuit de leverancier gestuurd. We kijken op de verpakkingen, we 
moeten veel meer nog onze  mensen instrueren, wat zijn onze mogelijkheden, wat zijn de trends in 
verduurzaming, zodat we ook onze klanten beter te woord kunnen staan. Uiteindelijk komt de klant 
binnen op prijs, vervolgens kun je de klant best wel bewegen een ander product aan te sc haffen, 
mits we daar meer over weten.”   
 
“Er zijn wel producten die zeker wat te bieden hebben in aanvullende informatie, maar over het 
algemeen is het vrij summier .” 
 
 
Uitvoering  
Daarnaast gaven medewerkers aan dat ze graag meer trainingen zouden willen krijgen over de uitvoering 
van bepaalde verduurzamingsmaatregelen en -producten. Deze kennis kunnen zij gebruiken bij het 
adviseren van klanten vanuit hun eigen ervaring met dit pro duct.   
 
“Daarom ben ik zelf ook voorstander van producttrainingen, zoals we die vroeger kenden, want dan 
moesten medewerkers het ook gewoon zelf doen. [..] En dat vertelt toch een stuk geloofwaardiger 
aan een klant toe. En zeker de moeilijke producten, bij voorbeeld isolatie. Over hoe die goed 
aangebracht moet worden. “  
 
“Ik zou nog wel meer kennis willen vergaren van een externe partner over hoe bijvoorbeeld een huis 
isoleert. Dus hoe werkt zo’n spuit, welke materiaal wordt in de muur gespoten. Je wilt wet en hoe het 
precies werkt.”  
 
 
Visualisatie  
Showmodel  
Een andere manier om medewerkers te ondersteunen bij het geven van advies is het visualeren van hoe 
een bepaald product eruit ziet en werkt . Eén van de manieren om dit te doen is door een showmodel in 
de winkel te plaatsen van bepaalde verduurzamingsmaatregelen , bijvoorbeeld een dwarsdoo rsnede van 
 17 een geïsoleerd (e) muur of  dak. Enkele vestigingen maken hier al gebruik van. Zo ’n showmodel  maak t het 
makkelijker voor  een medewerker om klanten te informeren en adviseren over welke  materialen  te 
gebruike n en hoe  de maatregelen  uit te voeren . Daarnaast kan zo’n showmodel ook een 
aanknopingspunt zijn om een gesprek met de klant te starten over wat ze  aan hun huis willen 
verduurzamen.  
 
“Voor klanten die aan het onderzoeken zijn en nog niet helemaal weten hoe het in zijn werk gaat, is 
dit [een showmodel , red] zeker een meerwaarde. Je kunt het ze laten zien.”   
 
“Voorheen, toen er nog geen showmodellen wa ren, zocht ik zo’n voorbeeld van een doorsnede op 
internet, maar zo’n model in de winkel werkt veel fijner.”   
 
“Deze modellen vind ik zelf heel fijn werken. Je kan klanten heel duidelijk uitleggen welke 
materialen nodig zijn. Je kan het laten zien en laten  voelen, dan snappen ze het wel.”  
 
 
Warmtescan  
Waarom het nodig is om te  isoleren en wat het effect kan zijn is niet altijd even zichtbaar. Medewerkers 
gaven aan dat het erg zou kunnen helpen als er voor klanten een warmtescan  voor hun woning 
beschikbaar wordt gesteld  of de medewerker een warmtebeeldcamera (in de verhuur) kan aanbieden . 
Een warmtescan maakt het v oor klanten namelijk heel duidelijk zichtbaar waar er warmte verloren gaat en 
waar zij dit kunnen beperken door beter te isoleren.   
 
“Ik zou graag een warmtebeeldcamera in mijn verhuur willen. [..] Dan maak je een foto van de 
gevel van je huis en dan zie je meteen waar alle kou zit en alle warmte zit. Hoe blauwer je foto, hoe 
beter je huis. Het is voor een klant dan heel visueel te maken”  
 
“Het is voor ons heel lastig om op afstand te zeggen, hoe kiert die voordeur. Zij 
[duurzaamheidsteam gemeente] kunnen met warmtecamera’s het gewoon blootleggen, waar zit 
die kier. Ze [bewoners , red] voelen wel tocht, maar weten in vredesnaam niet waar het vandaan 
komt.”  
 
 
QR-code bij schap  met doorverwijzing naar website  
Daarnaast kwam uit de gesprekken ook het idee naar voren om een QR -code  bij het schap van een 
product  te plaatsen , die verwijst naar relevante visuele informatie  over het product en hoe dit product 
wordt toegepast. Het delen van deze informatie is handig voor zowel de klant  als de medewerker .  
 
“Het zien v an iets is wel essentieel. Linken, QR codes, naar een goed YouTube  filmpje met een 
heldere uitleg, en daar ook een beschrijving bij. Ik denk dat dat in de basis… Als we dat al zouden 
bieden aan onze klanten..”   
 
Zo’n QR -code zou klanten bijvoorbeeld kunnen doorverwijzen naar de website van Doe Het Zelf Doe Het 
Duurzaam. Voor deze website  zijn er in samenwerking met verschillende bouwmarktketens kluswijzers 
opgesteld voor verschillende verduurzamingsmaatregelen. In  het gesprek kwam naar voren dat de 
meeste medewerkers (nog) niet bekend zijn met d eze website . De medewerkers die de website  wel 
kennen, omschrijven dat het hen zeker kan helpen in advisering over het nemen van 
verduurzamingsmaatregelen. Daarnaast geeft e en deel van de medewerkers aan voornamelijk gebruik te 
maken van  de eigen website van de keten waar instructiefilmpjes op staan.  
  18 “Is wel helder verhaal.  [..] Staat wel goed beschreven. Als je dit gaat printen en erbij gaat doen is de 
duurzaamheid ook weer  weg. Zoiets zou je met een QR code bij het schap kunnen plakken 
bijvoorbeeld.”  
 
“Ik denk dat het wel handig is als je dit ernaast hebt liggen terwijl je aan de gang gaat. [..]Gaat ook 
een hoop telefoontjes schelen denk ik . [..] Mensen die dan thuis bezig zijn met hun radiatorfolie en 
die dan zeggen oh wat voor tape moet daar o p.”   
 
 
Demonstratie   
Medewerkers gaven ook  aan dat een demonstratie  van een bepaald product  in of rondom de winkel 
nuttig kunnen zijn . Daarbij geven m eerdere medewerkers aan dat bij een  demonstratie het vooral erg 
belangrijk is dat een duurzaamheidsadviseur  met enthousiasme en passie kan vertellen over een product.   
 
“Nodig klanten uit voor een demonstratie van een expert. Tijdje terug iemand van zonnepanelen in 
de winkel, waarbij klanten zich konden inschrijven om hier een demonstratie over te volgen en 
advies te krijgen.”  
 
 
Ondersteuning v anuit de overheid  
Communiceer een e enduidig verhaal  
Medewerkers geven aan dat een eenduidig verhaal vanuit d e overheid wat betreft duurzaamheid 
belangrijk is. Nu verandert het verhaal in de beleving regelmatig. Medewerkers geven aan dat het zou 
kunnen helpen om vanuit de overheid een duidelijke aanpak naar de bouwmarktketens te communiceren 
en te ondersteunen bi j het opleid en van medewerkers, die dit op hun beurt weer kunnen overbrengen 
aan klanten . Daarnaast geven medewerkers aan dat de overheid kan helpen met bijvoorbeeld campagnes 
waarin mensen bewust worden gemaak t van de urgentie van isoleren  en worden gesti muleerd om dit 
ook daadwerkelijk te gaan doen. Maar ook waarom een bepaalde verandering, zoals de herijking van 
energielabels bij ledlampen , wordt doorgevoerd. Echter, er bestaat ook twijfel of het verstandig is om dit 
soort informatie vanuit de overheid te communicere n door weerstand tegenover de overheid of omdat 
veel mensen de overheid  niet (meer) serieus nemen , volgens een aantal medewerkers . Zij vragen zich af 
of de communicatie niet beter via de bouwmarkten  kan lopen.  
 
“Ik denk dat promoten wel heel goed is, dat denk ik echt. Ik weet alleen niet zo goed vanuit wie dat 
moet komen. Want ik denk ook dat er, helemaal tegenwoordig, een heleboel mensen zijn die de 
overheid n iet zo heel serieus meer nemen.”   
 
“Bijvoorbeeld nu met de led lampen. Zijn alle ledlampen geherijkt. [..] Ik sta nu aan een klant uit te 
leggen dat hij een lamp twee weken geleden gekocht heeft met een A++ label, waardoor hij zich 
groener dan groen waant , en die krijgt nu hetzelfde lampje met een F of G label. Ja, dat is wel even 
een dingetje om uit te leggen. [..] De noodzaak die snap ik, er komen steeds nieuwe technieken aan 
die nog milieubewuster zijn, [..] maar leg dat wel aan consumenten uit. .”  
 
“Ik denk dat mensen, die vertrouwen de overheid voor geen meter meer. [..] Dat het misschien wel 
werkt als de overheid het bij ons neerlegt en wij gaan proberen dat weer te verspreiden. Dat het wel 
één lijn is, dat ze vanuit de overheid alle bouwmarkten zelfd e cursus/opleiding/training geven, met 
een duidelijk draaiboek, dit is de beste manier om het te vertellen .”  
 
 
   19 Drempels s ubsidie  wegnemen  
Het krijgen van een subsidie is voor klanten een belangrijke trigger om de (hoge) kosten van het 
verduurzamen van hun woning te overbruggen. Echter, een subsidieaanvraag  brengt  veel werk met zich 
mee en de klant krijgt het geld pas achteraf terug. Daarbij vormen de eisen aan subsidies vaak een 
drempel. Vo lgens de medewerkers zou het nuttig kunnen zijn om de voorwaarden om in aanmerking te 
komen voor subsidie te ver soepelen  en om vooraf kortingen te geven  in plaats van subsidies achteraf  
terug te betalen . 
 
“De burger het hapklaar aanbrengen, wat is er allemaal mogelijk . En niet de stap om een subsidie 
aan te vragen dat dat zo veel werk is , dat mensen denken : ‘laat dan maar zitten ’.”  
 
“Er zijn nogal wat eisen aan verbonden [aan de subsidie, red] . Als je wilt gaan verduurzamen, moet 
je hier aan voldoen, daar aan voldoen. Dat moet je kunnen. Dat is vaak e en drempel voor de 
consument, voor de klant om dat te gaan regelen.”  
 
“Ik denk vaak dat de wil er wel is, alleen het prijskaartje gewoon te hoog is. Dus ja een van de 
oplossingen zou kunnen zijn om die subsidies breder te trekken, en te vergemakkelijken.”  
 
Naast het verlagen van drempels voor klanten, geven medewerkers aan dat zij ook graag meer betrokken 
worden en tijdig worden geïnformeerd over initiatieven die bij verschillende gemeentes worden 
ontwikkeld. Hierbij zou het erg helpen als verschillende gem eentes een soortgelijke aanpak hanteren.  
 
“Elke gemeente is eigenlijk vrij om die subsidieregeling uit te voeren. Dat zorgt voor ons in de 
uitvoerende fase zoveel complexiteit. Kijk maar hoe je bijvoorbeeld de betaling van de 
cadeaubonnen moet borgen in je kassasystemen. Als er voor subsidies nou eens vanuit de overheid 
één uniforme procedure voor zou opgesteld zijn. Dat vereenvoudigt de complexiteit niet alleen voor 
de gemeente, ook voor ons, dat zou enorm helpen.”

Volgens medewerkers belangrijkste triggers woning verduurzamen: • Financiële triggers : Medewerkers gaven verduurzaming woning voornamelijk financieel gedreven is. Denk hierbij besparen energiekosten, vouchers vanuit gemeentes (vooral kleine verduurzamingsmaatregelen radiatorfolie led lamp en) subsidies (voornamelijk grote verduurzamingsmaatregelen isolatie). • zichtbaarheid impact , 3D -showmodel winkel warmtescan woning , trigger genoemd aanleidin g klantgesprek . • (sociale ) omgeving klant , buren familie , informatie vanuit media, bedrijven overheid invloed keuzes klant verduurzamen . • medewerkers verschil interesse verduurzaming . Zo woningeigenaren algemeen geïnteresseerd isolatie . Huurders daarentegen kopen vaker kleine(re) verduurzamingsmaatregelen, radiatorfolie, toc htstrips ledlampen. belangrijkste drempels medewerkers gebied woningverduurzaming zijn: • Hoge(re) kosten duurzame ten opzichte alternatieve producten, hoge investeringskosten grote verduurzamingsmaatregelen, isolatie . • Gebrek kennis n ut noodzaak verduurzamen, uitvoeren klus. subsidie aanvragen. • uitzoekwerk hoeveelheid informatie verduurzaming uitvoeren klus, isolatie, brengt daarnaast hoop gedoe klant mee.

Er samenwerking drie bouwmarktketens totaal vier focusgroepen georganiseerd medewerkers functies vestigingen . doel inzicht krijgen gesprekken medewerkers bouwmarkten verduurzaming advies hierover bevorderd worden. focusgro epen vonden plaats november 2021 januari 2022 . project onderdeel traject waarin directie Klimaat Behavioural Insights Team Ministerie Economische Zaken Klimaat samenwerking externe partijen ki jken rol intermediairs energietransitie . Eerder gekeken rol cv-installateurs .1 Intermediairs direct contact consument momenten waarop duurzaamheidsbeslissingen genomen . Door expertise adviesrol belangrijke invloed beslissingen consument. Aan hand focusgroepen achterhalen intermediairs ondersteund rol binnen klimaattransitie: welke factoren (belemmeringen juist kansen) spelen rol inspelen? 2 Opzet Focusgroepen Onder leiding ervaren externe gespreksleider vier (online) focusgroepen georganiseerd elk vier á vijf medewerkers. Middels focusgroepen verkend medewerkers bouwmarkten werk klantgesprekken ondersteund advies verduurzaming: ➢ vra gen krijgen medewerkers verduurzaming? ➢ Welke triggers barri ères bouwmarktmedewerkers verduurzamen? ➢ Nemen medewerkers duurzaamheidsaspecten mee advies klanten? ➢ Hoe vinden medewerkers advisere n duurzaamheid? ➢ Op welke informatie baseren advies? ➢ Hoe advies eventueel vergemakkelijkt worden? Deelnemers Aan focusgroepen 17 medewerkers functies vestigingen drie bouwmarktketens deelgenomen. functies liepen uiteen winkelmedewerker , (assistent) bedrijfsleider , winkelmanager. aantal jaar werkervaring binnen desbetreffende bouwmarktketen verschilde 1 jaar 20 jaar. Werving r epresentativiteit Middels oproep stuurgroep Doe Zelf Doe Duurzaam contactpersonen benaderd binnen bouwmarktketens bezighouden duurzaamheid . medewerkers deelgenomen focusgroepen geworven via contactpersonen . Van vestigingen gesproken hebben, één meerdere medewerkers gespecialiseerd thema duurzaamheid. Er verwacht particip erende 1 Rijksoverheid. (2021). CV monteurs energietransitie, https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/rapporten/2021/09/24/cv -monteurs -en-de-energietransitie 6 medewerkers voorbaat bovengemiddeld geïnteresseerd onderwerp duurzaamheid daarmee representatief alle bouwmarktmedewerkers . aard onderzoek kwalitatief, waarbij hand open sp ecifieke interviewtechnieken doorgevraagd “het waarom” achter antwoorden. Er basis resultaten harde conclusies getrokken meningen voorkomen totale doelgroep. 3 Woningverduurzaming context bouwmarkt Aan begin groepsgesprek bouwmarktmedewer kers gevraagd eerst hen opkomt “verduurzaming woning”. word cloud hieronder geeft associaties bouwmarktmedewe rkers verduurzaming woning aan, waarbij begrippen groter afgebeeld vaker voorkwamen. Bouwmarktmedewerkers denken eerste instantie isolatie energie besparen. komen primair associaties boven assortiment duurzame producten. Specieke genoemd led verlichting, tochtstrips radiatorfolie . Zowel kleinere energiebesparende radiatorfolie, tochtstrips ledlampen, grotere projecten isolatie kwamen elvuldig terug gesprekken . 4 Woningverduurzaming 4.1 Triggers verduurzamen Financiële triggers In algemeen bouwmarktmedewerkers stijgende interesse energie besparen . Er opgemerkt isoleren aantal jaar geleden vaker deden gingen verbouwen, terwijl vaker doel is. “Afgelopen jaren soms hadden woning stoppen, namen mee gingen verbouwen. Nu anders ” Van triggers bouwmarktmedewerkers verduurzamen, kwam name financiële motief duidelijk voren . stijgende energieprijzen vouchers gemeenten uitgeven werden veelv uldig genomend directe aanleiding . Medewerkers indruk weinig waarbij klimaat belangrijkste reden verduurzamen. Besparing energi ekosten (door stijgende energieprijzen) Van redenen bouwmarktmedewerkers klant verduurzamingsmaatregelen nemen staat stip nummer 1: geld besparen. Veel advies hoeveel specifiek 7 product besparen lijken vooral geïnteresseerd duurzame productgroepen financieel voordeel halen. Bij waarbij duurzaamheidsaspect vooral zit productie eigenschappen product, verf hout, moeilijker bewegen duurzame variant. “Er zit vast tussen echt mee bezig [met klimaat , red] overgrote deel portemonnee maken .” “Ik denk vooral productgroepen financi eel voordeel halen, isolatie, waterbesparing soort dingen. denk prijsverschil duurzame verf, denk lastiger verkopen. [..] Degene duurzame ver f kiest, financieel gewin . echt puur verduurzaming product gemaakt is, beter milieu , afweging verf kopen.“ Daarnaas vraag energiebesparen sterk toegenomen recent gestegen energieprijzen . “Door stijgende gasprijzen vraag isolati duurzame enorm stroomversnelling gekomen .” “De isolatiebehoefte natuurlijk al, huidige gasprijs geeft laatste schopje. Zo van, ga echt doen, echt zin. Of tenminste levert snel geld op. “ Vouchers gemeenten Sommige gemeentes stellen vouchers rond 5 0 Euro beschikbaar inwoners besteden duurzame bouwmarkten . Medewerkers omschrijven run bepaalde winkel wanneer kortingsbonnen uitgegeven . Klanten kopen voornamelijk kleine energiebesparende maatregelen, led lampen radiatorfolie . “Radiatorfolie .. Mensen komen beurt binnen, hee krijg subsidie, krijg [..]. En werkt .” “Ik denk nieuwe streep getrokken, denk ar aanleiding gasprijzen gingen doen, subsidie. […] Bij bedeeld zijn, zeker pas, anders uitgesteld hadden gaan. ” Subsidie Hoewel welke subsidies aanvragen doen, blijven subsidies belangrijke trigger verduurzamen. geldt name grote energiebesparende maatregelen, isoleren wo ning. ""Als erachter komen subsidie krijgen, laten doen.” “Ik denk bang nou boot mis. Als nou isoleer, nou gebruik maak mogelijkheden , straks betalen subsidiepot is.” 8 Zichtbaar maken Volgens medewerkers duurzame streep halen schaffen. voorbeeld hierbij genoemd 3D-showmodel leggen welke materialen isoleren zien. duidelijk zichtbaar maken noodzaak isoleren werkt motiverend. In gesprekken daarvoor warmtescan genoemd voorbeeld v oor visualiseren goed (of slecht) huis geïsoleerd is. stimuleert verduurzamingsproducten schaffen. “Het verschil tussen led lamp halogeen lamp kun vrij snel laten zien. Als laat duidelijker klant. Met isolatie vertellen niet. denk groot verschil maakt. ” “Zien overtuigen. Als ziet werkt, zonnepanelen spouwmuurisolatie, makkelijker streep trekken.” Invloeden vanuit (sociale) omgeving Bouwmarktmedewerkers sociale omgeving buren familie klant invloed keuzes verduurzamen. informatie vanuit media, bedrijven overheid stimuleert woning verduurzamen volgens bouwmarktmedewerkers. “Ik denk ‘mee ’, zien, trend. zeggen buurvrouw doet het, ga .” “Laatst drie buren drie tegelijk vloer via kruipruimte gingen isoleren .” “Ik idee iedereen nou bedacht spouwmuur gaat isoleren dergelijks . [..] natuurlijk gedreven informatie buiten af daardoor getriggerd daadwerkelijk handelen. ” Interesse verduurzaming Kopers versus huurders Bouwmarktmedewerkers merken duidelijk versch il tussen woning eigenaren huurders motivatie verduurzamen, name terug productkeuze . Huurders kopen vaker kleine(re) verduur zamingsmaatregelen, radiatorfolie, tochtstrips ledlampen. Woningeigenaren daarentegen algemeen geinteresseerd isolatie . “Huurders voornamelijk radiatorfolie stookkosten bespaart, tochtstrip huurbaas doen. Er groot verschil tussen koop huurwoningen. ” “Klanten koopwoning graag isoleren; stukje eigenbelang .” Leeftijd Leeftijd lijkt mee spelen bereidheid woning verduurzamen. Uit focusgroepen kwam voren geïnteresseerd duurzaamheid duurzaamheidsmaatregelen -producten algemeen jong zijn. “Vaak jongeren, denk jaar 30, 35. Daarboven zie echt oude gedrag terugkomen. “ 9 “Voornamelijk oudere denken huis goed geïsoleerd is, beseffen hoeveel ermee besparen. ” 4.2 Drempels verduurzaming Medewerkers basis gesprekken winkel drempels woning verduurzamen. name hoge (re) kosten , gebrek kennis gedoe kijken uitzoeken uitvoeren verduurzamingsmaatregelen . Hoge (re) kosten duurzame hoge(re) kosten verduurzamingsmaatregelen veelvuldig drempel genoemd, name grote investering woningisol atie. kosten hoger voren verwachten. “Als elkaar optelt, groot bedrag kwijt. Kleine maatregelen tochtstrips helpen wel, maken grote verschillen. h et echte grote isolatie werk bedrag ophoesten.” “Als gaat isoleren, raad klimaatfolie . vervolgens weer aftapen speciaal tape. Dan laat [de klant en] rolletjes duc ttape doen. Maar weer terug af. Zo lopen kosten langzaam steeds verder op. Sommige besluiten alsnog doen. En anderen niet. ” Daarnaas verschil tussen productgroepen. Bij waterbesparende douchekoppen prijsverschil groot , waardoor eerder duurzame optie kopen . Bij (led)lampen daarentegen, speelt prijsverschil rol aankoopbeslissing. “Bij waterbesparende douchekop zit prijsverschil in, maakt klant duurzaams koopt duurzaams . [..]Daar zie helpt, [.. ] ziet echt letten f duurzame douchekop kopen. ” “Leuk besparing [de ledlamp], lamp kost zes keer zoveel.” Gebrek kennis Bouwmarktmedewerkers gebrek kennis klanten, hen ervan weerhoudt woning verduur zamen. gaat vooral om: 1) Nut noodzaa k verduurzamen : huis (verder) verduurzamen besparing maatregelen k unnen leveren 2) Uitvoering klus: Mensen klus pakken denken kunnen. zorgt ervoor orienteren verduurzamingsproducten ondanks interesse beginnen verduurzamingsmaatregelen gevoel klus kunn voeren (en klus kunnen/willen laten doen) . “Er stukje onwetendheid gebrek kennis. Voornamelijk oudere denken huis goed geïsoleerd is, beseffen hoeveel ermee besparen.” “Sommige w eten bepaalde klus denken kunnen.” 10 “Ik denk denken simpel is. bedrijf gedaan moéten worden. [..] Omd bekend zo’n plafond isoleren is. “ Subsidie Waar subsidie algemeen belangrijke trigger verduurzamen, brengt aantal drempels mee. Zo gebruik maken subsidie aanvragen. noemen bouwmarktmedewerkers feit subsidie krijgen isolatie maatregelen word uitgevoerd extern bedrijf , klus z elf uitvoeren . Bouwmarktmedewerkers gemiste kans stimuleren verduurzamen. “Nee, subsidie is. adviseer vaak.” “Voor aanbrengen isolatie extern bedrijf subsidie, isolatiemateriaal niet.” “Er nogal eisen verbonden [aan subsidie, red] . Als wilt verduurzamen, voldoen, voldoen. kunnen. drempel voo r consument, klant regelen.” Gedoe Uitzoekwerk Er informatie internet vinden woning verduurzamen. Daarbij keuzes maken voorbereidingsproces. k ertoe leiden bomen bos daardoor laten woning. “Als keer zonnepanelen googled overspoeld informatie.” “Doordat internet vinden is, zie keuzestress hebben.” “Ene kant voordeel internet orienteren kant staat elke leverancier eigen product. Dan mag jij klant vertellen welke product beste is.” Uitvoering klus brengen sommige verduurzamingsmaatregelen gedoe mee. Denk isoleren vloer, spouwmuur dak. Doordat tegenop zien, bereid woning verduurzamen. “Bij isolatie kunn klus zien. [..] Als plafonnetje wilt isoleren ofzo, gedoe.” 11 5 Adviesrol medewerkers Tijdens focusgroepen gesproken duurzaamheid ter sprake gesprekken adviseren gebied duurzaamheid . Vragen hierbij bod kwamen waren: vinden medewerkers ervan advies duurzaamheid ? Waarop baseren advies? Waar lopen tegenaan adviseren ? En hen helpen advies ? 5.1 Vragen duurzaamheid Klanten komen gericht winkel Klanten komen gericht winkel aanpakken huis , voordat bouwmarkt binnenlopen. Duurzaamheid daarmee meestal onderwerp spontaan ter sprake komt. “De binnenkomen tevoren bedacht isoleren. [..] Er komen weinig binnen boor kopen toevallig ongeluk z’n winkelmandje isolatierol meeneemt. ” “Mensen waarvoor bouwmarkt komen online itgezocht. Vaak rol daarin bevestigen klopt klant uitgezocht aanvullend advies geven.” Vragen besparing Vragen relatie duurzaamheid type materiaal n odig . Dan gaat welk materiaal toepassing situatie (welk isolatiemateriaal ?, schuin dak?) , verschillen tussen , besparen bepaalde producten. “Radiatorfolie best regelmatig verkocht. We twee soorten liggen welke beste rendement, gaat besparen ? [..] Ja dikkere geeft beste besparing waarschijnlij k. echt vraag komt. ” “De vraag komt, x aantal rollen staan, welke nou doen? Moet rol A,B,C hebben. eigenlijk vraag meest komt, naast vraag ligt het. ” “Klanten hoeveel bepaald product besparen. ledlamp zes keer duur gewone lamp. Klanten besparing oplevert, anders kopen liever goedkopere lamp.” Advies alternatieve pro ducten Klanten online opgezocht welk product bevestiging klopt. Medewerkers soms advies welk alternatieve product klant beste gebruiken. “Het vooral belangrijk goed lichten. Je doen. soms dingen afgeraden doen. Bijvoorbeeld piepschuim isoleren, terwijl glaswol effectiever is.” “Soms krijg eigenwijze online opgezocht ho moet, juiste manier doen.” 12 5.2 Houding tegenover adviesrol merendeel medewerkers gaf hij/zij affiniteit onderwerp duurzaamheid eft graag adviseert . Daarbij duurzaamheid onderwerp klant begint . Sommige medewerkers beginnen verduurzaming, anderen vinden gepast. “Ik beetje groene fanaat (lachend). vind belangrijk [het mil ieu, red] goed mee gaan. [..]Als klant dragen graag. goal.” “Weinig klimaat eerst komt, gevoel initiatief [voor duurzaamheid , red] vandaan komt. D uurzame mogelijkheden ter sprake gebracht worden.” “Je bent bezig verkoop adviesgesprek meteen duurzaamheid hebben. Als vraag gesteld merkt persoon interesse ter sprake brengen, first mind begin.” “Je wilt wens klant vervullen, product aanbieden klant behoefte heeft. energiebespa ringsproduct gewen st ga aanbieden. ter sprake brengen.” Eigen ervaring meerderheid medewerkers gaf zijn/haar advies baseren eigen ervaring huis verduurzaming gedaan. Hoewel iedere ervaring heeft, consensus goed werkt eigen ervaringen delen gesprek klant. Door praktijksituaties beschrijven klant concreter gemaakt welke stappen onde rnemen bepaalde maatregelen , hen eerder overtuigen verduurzamingsmaatregelen nemen . “Het persoonlijke contact klant zeggen heb, zorgt ervoor eerder bereid isoleren.” “Het werkt wel, zo’n smart systeem, hele huis mee vol hangen. elke klant voordelen vertellen. werkt. Ergens idee beetje denken ‘zij verstand , ’.” “Ik huis helemaal omgezet ledverlichting, scheelt echt aanzienlijk echt vertellen bespaart.” “Ik woon buurt weet huizen buurt staan. huis label A gemaakt. Persoonlijk contact maakt klant gelooft, “Ik ervaring ermee” werkt altijd. ” Doorverwijzing website, filmpje s, exter ne partij Medewerkers bepaalde kennis (nog) hebben, Rd -waarde product, opzoeken internet. verwijzen medewerkers interessante websites filmpjes waarin verschillend verduurzaamings maatregelen toepassing bepaalde uitgelegd. 13 “Ik laat onze website filmpjes uitleg maatregelen. Vervolgens loop klant mee schappen. klant eerste instantie dacht.” “De dingen meegeef offertes maken. Brochures beetje anno 2000, tegenwoordig staat online. [Keten, red] ontiegelijk instructiefilmpjes online staan YouTube grote helper in. Daar staat op, terugvinden. Generatie visueel zien.” “We verwijzen website, aannemer aanschrijven, offerte laten opstellen bepaalde klus doen, klusservice. Of stappenplannen gebruik bepaald product nou. natuurlijk visueel makkelijker leggen winkel verhaaltje staat vertellen. Dus gebruiken regelmatig verwijzen.” “Op meeste isolatie staan RH waarden op. Meestal google even, zoveel, zoveel..” Op moment voldoende is, klus complex klant wil/kan uitvoeren, verwijzen medewerkers externe partij uitvoeringsbedrijf gemeente. “Wat doe advise ik, joh neem contact gemeente , duurzaamheidsteam, komen gratis langs brengen advies uit. Als advies hebt, kijken vinden. ” “Als merken klant cht [doorverwijzen uitvoeringspartner , red]. Als echt gebrek kennis wel” Herkenbaarheid duurzaamheidsspecialist aantal bouwmarktmedewerkers draagt kleding waaraan herkend duurzaamheidsspecialist. Zij helpt adviseren . Klanten reageren hierdoor anders hen komen ander soort wanneer herkenbare kleding dragen. “Ik merk anders word aangesproken wanneer groene blouse draag wanneer blauwe blouse draag. krijg hele gesprekken.” “Klanten nemen eerder gebied verduurzaming herkenbare kleding draagt.” Productafdeling showmo del Bij sommige vestigingen afdeling winkel verduurzamingsproducten verkocht en/of staat 3D-showmodel dwarsdoorsnede geïsoleerd(e) muur dak. Medewerkers erg enthousiast over, makkelijker maakt advies isoleren. bouwmarktmedewerkers aanleiding klant af stappen advies bieden. “In winkel staat verduurzamingshuis. doorsnedes spouwmuren dak. Als daarnaar zie kijken stap erop af helpen.” 14 “Bij zuil kijken medewerkers samen via online platform huis verduurzamen. Je laat website zien, filmpjes loopt klant mee producten.” 5.3 Drempels medewerkers advisering Uit gesprekken kwam voren da medewerkers aantal dingen aanlopen gaat adviseren verduurzaming smaatregelen -producten . Aan ene kant soms lastig onvoldoende inhoudelijke kennis lastig kennis brengen klanten. Bij isolatie vinden lastig advies afstand geven, maatwerk is. (mede dankzij toegenome n vraag) steeds vaker gebrek materiaal is. Niet juiste onvoldoende inhoudelijke kennis deel medewerkers geeft gevoel juiste onvoldoende inhoudelijk kennis advies verduurzaming . Enkele mede werkers (online ) training gevolgd duurzaamheid . Zij inhoudelijk genoeg onderwerp weten, aar hen blijken bepaald product qua kostenbesparing oplevert moeilijk beantwoorden . Vanuit klant juist vraag . “Dan gaat reductie opleveren? Ja , lastig zeggen. Je natuurlijk geïsoleerde voordeur tochtstrippen , sta nul. lastige. mo et zeggen, krijgen zeggen: helpen, helpen? En qua kennis, eigenlijk. “ “De basis weet wel, [..] nou precies werkt. Ja, plaats wel, nou oplevert, voordeel ervan? Dus eigenlijk , denk 40% informatie geven. We praktische informatie financiële informatie. [..] lastig.” “Bij radiatorventilatoren, staat daadwerkelijk pakketje bespaart zoveel procent energierekening. Maar soort termen staan isolatierollen. Dus theoretisch verhaal. Ja, isoleert bespaar je. Thats’it. En ene bespaar minder. [ ..] nou 1 80% leesb aar, leggen.” “Maar financiele onderbouwing lastig maken medewerkers. Van joh, hoeveel ga nou extra bezuinigen drie cm dikker isolatie neem. financiele gewin eraan hebben, moeilijk leggen . Waardoor koopgedrag mist.” “[hoeveel oplevert] hangt zoveel factoren af, hangt montage methode klant af, ie goed doet, ie juiste manier doet, ie folies juiste manier verwerkt behandelt. Isolatie eigenlijk l astig vak, isoleren eigenlijk kunst. “Als klant winkel vraagt product achterhoofd meeneemt , [..] duurzaam advies geven. Dan categorieën ander doen, zat groepen know hebt, lippen ligt. dacht bijverwarming, pak kacheltj e, kijk welke grotere opbrengst welke kleinere opbrengst. [..] dvies erbij zijn, [..]. Daar verdiepen.“ 15 Overbrengen kennis lastig Naast onvoldoende kennis, medewerkers overbrengen kennis lastig is. Advies duurzaamheidsmaatregelen -producten ee n technisch theoretisch verhaal. overbrengen kennis name lastig product impact product zichtbaar bouwmarkt. Verschillende medewerkers lopen feit verschil tussen prod uct x product lastig laten is, terwijl precies verschil tussen producten. “Het verschil tussen led lamp halogeen lamp kun vrij snel laten zien. Als laat uidelijker klant. Met isolatie vertellen niet. denk groot verschil maakt.” “Komt klant winkel, ziet allemaal pakken isolatie, ziet balken hout, ziet plafondplaatjes. Maar ja, hele plan bedenken één [geheel, red] wordt.” Tekort materiaal Medewerkers stijgen energieprijzen wanneer gemeente kortingsbon verstuurd inwoners, run bepaalde ontstaat. resulteert tekort materiaal . geeft enkele winkelaanbod bouwmarkt acherloopt materialen markt beschikbaar zijn, isolatie . zaken maken lastig medewerkers advies geven. “Ja radiatorfolie, inmiddels. echt enorm hard gegaan sinds gasprijs hard omhoog ging. “ “Sommige leveranciers moment leveren. Dan gesprek bezig, bepaald product toe, meer, weer alternatief zoeken. [..] Schaarste . krijg grote aanloop keer.” “Nu vanuit gemeente voucher huis verdurzamen, voornamelijk ledverlichting, radiatorfolie. Veel slepen winkel. Je merkt gelijk run op.” “Als kijk isolatiemateriaal wol, tegenwoordig pirplaten, isoleren beter, makkelijker verwerken, hebt mondkapje nodig, handschoenen nodig, allemaal voors klanten. weliswaar duurder dunner materiaal dezelfde isolatiewaarde halen. [..] innovaties terug zie komen.” 16 6 Kansrijke ideeën medewerkers ondersteunen advies Tijdens focusgroepen besproken medewerkers helpen adviseren. ontbreekt adviseren makkelijker maken? ideeën voren kwamen, zitten vooral verbeteren eigen kennis, informatie visualisatie . gevraagd welke oplossingsrichtingen vanuit overheid medewerkers energietransitie bespoe digen. Training medewerkers verduurzaming woning Producten Eén voornaamste drempels medewerkers tegenaan lopen adviseren, gebrek juiste kennis. Medewerkers geholpen aanvullende informatie verduurzaming woning. Hierbij gaat voorbeeld overzicht Rd - waardes tool specifiek product rekenen gemiddelde besparing energie(kosten) klant . “Ik lijstje zien, deur tochtstrippen deur tochtstrippen, [..] doet R -waarde. dak geïsoleerd, garagewand geïsoleerd. Of deur geïsoleerd. Daar voors zien. Nu elk keer googelen gokken, gaat zoveel schelen. [..] Dan zichtbaar iets, even laten zien.” “Wat teveel vanuit leverancier gestuurd. We kijken verpakkingen, onze instrueren, onze mogelijkheden, trends verduurzaming, zodat onze beter woord staan. Uiteindelijk klant binnen prijs, vervolgens kun klant best bewegen ander product sc haffen, mits weten.” “Er zeker bieden aanvullende informatie, algemeen vrij summier .” Uitvoering gaven medewerkers graag trainingen zouden krijgen uitvoering bepaalde verduurzamingsmaatregelen -producten. kennis gebruiken adviseren vanuit eigen ervaring pro duct. “Daarom voorstander producttrainingen, vroeger kenden, moesten medewerkers doen. [..] En vertelt stuk geloofwaardiger klant toe. En zeker moeilijke producten, voorbeeld isolatie. Over goed aangebracht worden. “ “Ik kennis vergaren externe partner huis isoleert. Dus werkt zo’n spuit, welke materiaal muur gespoten. Je wilt wet precies werkt.” Visualisatie Showmodel manier medewerkers ondersteunen advies visualeren bepaald product eruit ziet werkt . Eén manieren showmodel winkel plaatsen bepaalde verduurzamingsmaatregelen , dwarsdoo rsnede 17 geïsoleerd (e) muur dak. Enkele vestigingen maken gebruik van. Zo ’n showmodel maak makkelijker informeren adviseren welke materialen gebruike n maatregelen voeren . zo’n showmodel aanknopingspunt gesprek klant starten huis verduurzamen. “Voor onderzoeken helemaal werk gaat, [een showmodel , red] zeker meerwaarde. Je kunt laten zien.” “Voorheen, showmodellen wa ren, zocht zo’n voorbeeld doorsnede internet, zo’n model winkel werkt fijner.” “Deze modellen vind fijn werken. Je duidelijk uitleggen welke materialen zijn. Je laten laten voelen, snappen wel.” Warmtescan Waarom isoleren effect even zichtbaar. Medewerkers gaven erg helpen warmtescan woning beschikbaar gesteld warmtebeeldcamera (in verhuur) aanbieden . warmtescan maakt v oor namelijk duidelijk zichtbaar warmte verloren gaat beperken beter isoleren. “Ik graag warmtebeeldcamera verhuur willen. [..] Dan maak foto gevel huis zie meteen alle kou zit alle warmte zit. Hoe blauwer foto, beter huis. klant visueel maken” “Het lastig afstand zeggen, kiert voordeur. Zij [duurzaamheidsteam gemeente] warmtecamera’s blootleggen, zit kier. [bewoners , red] voelen tocht, vredesnaam vandaan komt.” QR-code schap doorverwijzing website kwam gesprekken idee voren QR -code schap product plaatsen , verwijst relevante visuele informatie product product toegepast. delen informatie handig zowel klant . “Het v essentieel. Linken, QR codes, goed YouTube filmpje heldere uitleg, beschrijving bij. denk basis… Als zouden bieden onze klanten..” Zo’n QR -code doorverwijzen website Doe Zelf Doe Duurzaam. website samenwerking bouwmarktketens kluswijzers opgesteld verduurzamingsmaatregelen. In gesprek kwam voren meeste medewerkers (nog) bekend eze website . medewerkers website kennen, omschrijven hen zeker helpen advisering nemen verduurzamingsmaatregelen. geeft deel medewerkers voornamelijk gebruik maken eigen website keten instructiefilmpjes staan. 18 “Is helder verhaal. [..] Staat goed beschreven. Als gaat printen erbij gaat duurzaamheid weer weg. Zoiets QR code schap plakken bijvoorbeeld.” “Ik denk handig ernaast hebt liggen terwijl gang gaat. [..]Gaat hoop telefoontjes schelen denk . [..] Mensen thuis bezig radiatorfolie zeggen oh tape p.” Demonstratie Medewerkers gaven demonstratie bepaald product rondom winkel nuttig . Daarbij eerdere medewerkers demonstratie vooral erg belangrijk duurzaamheidsadviseur enthousiasme passie vertellen product. “Nodig demonstratie expert. Tijdje terug zonnepanelen winkel, waarbij konden inschrijven demonstratie volgen advies krijgen.” Ondersteuning v anuit overheid Communiceer enduidig verhaal Medewerkers eenduidig verhaal vanuit overheid betreft duurzaamheid belangrijk is. Nu verandert verhaal beleving regelmatig. Medewerkers helpen vanuit overheid duidelijke aanpak bouwmarktketens communiceren ondersteunen bi j opleid medewerkers, beurt weer overbrengen . medewerkers overheid helpen campagnes waarin bewust gemaak urgentie isoleren gesti muleerd daadwerkelijk doen. Maar bepaalde verandering, herijking energielabels ledlampen , doorgevoerd. Echter, bestaat twijfel verstandig soort informatie vanuit overheid communicere n weerstand tegenover overheid overheid (meer) serieus nemen , volgens aantal medewerkers .

Leeswijzer  Deze rapportage is te lezen door professionals van Atlas Leefomgeving, en mensen die zich bezig houden met de energietransitie en hoe deze landt bij de Nederlandse burger.   In deze rapportage leest u over hoe mensen die nadenken over, of bezig zijn met verhuizen en/of verbouwen, de energietransitie beleven. De opbrengsten van de dialogen geven inzicht in de informatiebehoefte rondom verduurzaming en de energietransitie. De inzichten vormen brandstof voor het ontwerp van de informatiepagina over de energietransitie op de website van Atlas Leefomgeving. Alle inzichten zijn gebaseerd op wat mensen ons hebben verteld.   De rapportage is als volgt opgebouwd: het eerste deel beschrijft de aanleiding, doelstelling en onderzoeksvraag van het onderzoek. Het tweede omvat deel de onderzoeksmethode- en aanpak. Het derde deel beschrijft de opbrengsten van het onderzoek, bestaande uit belevingsinzichten en aanwijzingen vanuit de burger voor succesvolle communicatie. De rapportage sluit af met een bijlage met concrete vragen van de gesprekspartners t.a.v. de energietransitie thuis en in de buurt.

1. De aanleiding, doel en vraag van het onderzoek  1.1 Aanleiding en doel van het onderzoek  Dit onderzoek is uitgevoerd in opdracht van het Ministerie van Infrastructuur en Waterstaat (MinIenW).   Na succesvolle onderzoeken in het afgelopen jaar blijft het programma Atlas Leefomgeving volop in ontwikkeling. Er zijn nieuwe elementen toegevoegd aan de website, waarbij er nieuwe vragen liggen. TrueTalk, specialist op het gebied van bijzondere onderzoeken en bijzondere doel- groepen, is gevraagd om te helpen met onderzoek waarbij de nadruk nu ligt op UX-testen. Zo versterkt Atlas het gebruikersgericht werken, en ontwikkelt haar diensten waarbij ze feeling houdt met de doelgroep.  Een van de ontwikkelingen waar Atlas Leefomgeving mee bezig is, is een vernieuwing van de webpagina over de energietransitie. De energietransitie is echter een breed thema met een groot aantal mogelijke onderwerpen waar Atlas Leefomgeving op in kan gaan. Om aansluiting te vinden met de burger heeft zij het doel gesteld  om samen met TrueTalk onderzoek te doen naar waar de informatiebehoefte omtrent de energietransitie ligt, en zo brandstof op te halen voor de inhoudelijke vormgeving van de nieuwe webpagina.   1.2 De vraag van Atlas Leefomgeving aan TrueTalk:   “Wat is de informatiebehoefte met betrekking tot de energietransitie van mensen die nadenken over, of bezig zijn met verhuizen/verbouwen?”

2. Onderzoeksmethode en de aanpak   Dit hoofdstuk gaat in op de keuze voor kwalitatief onderzoek en de onderzoeksmethode die we voor het veldwerk hebben gebruikt. Het biedt inzicht in de aanpak van het project, en geeft het een overzicht van de spreiding in gesprekspartners die deel hebben genomen aan het onderzoek.    2.1 Onderzoeksmethoden   ‘Empathy’ en kwalitatief onderzoek  De vraag van Atlas Leefomgeving was even concreet als verkennend. Bij dit soort semi-exploratieve vraagstukken is kwalitatief onderzoek tussen de mensen vrijwel altijd de aangewezen methode om te leren over de belevingswereld, behoeftes en emoties van burgers. In de wereld van Design Thinking heet dit ‘Empathy’. Wij faciliteerden directe, laagdrempelige en menselijke dialogen met een open karakter, waarbij we met burgers spraken die niet eerder met onderzoek hadden meegedaan. Ook met personen die niet altijd makkelijk uit hun woorden komen en door verschillende redenen moeilijker bereikbaar zijn. Empathy en kwalitatief onderzoek gaven ons de mogelijkheid om het echte gesprek aan te gaan en hen echt te kunnen begrijpen.   Dialogen Een diverse groep gesprekspartners betekent uiteenlopende verhalen, ervaringen en informatiebehoeftes. TrueTalk koos daarom voor de open dialoogvorm in plaats van strakke interviews. Kenmerkend aan interviews is dat de vragenlijst leidend is, en dat er voor de onderzoeker geen tot weinig ruimte overblijft om mee te kunnen bewegen met onderwerpen die voor de gesprekspartners belangrijk zijn. In een dialoog daarentegen, kan iedereen daadwerkelijk kwijt wat ze kwijt willen. Zo kan een natuurlijk gesprek ontstaan waarbij het echte verhaal verteld wordt. Daarnaast stelt de dialoog de onderzoeker in staat om door te vragen op wat gesprekspartners vertellen, en ontstaat de mogelijkheid om meer de diepte in te gaan.

Om structuur te geven aan de dialogen en Atlas Leefomgeving te helpen het meeste uit de gesprekken te halen, ontwikkelde TrueTalk een gespreksleidraad. De gespreksleidraad was zo opgebouwd dat natuurlijk lopende gesprekken waren verzekerd. Daarbij was het doel om de dialogen laagdrempelig te maken zodat iedereen kon meepraten. Dit betekent dat wij bij het ontwerp van de leidraad een vertaalslag maakten van de onderzoeksvraag van Atlas Leefomgeving naar een vorm die begrijpelijk is en aansluit op de spreektaal van gesprekspartners. Daarbij hielden we bij het ontwerp rekening met de mogelijkheid dat gesprekspartners moeite zouden hebben om concrete antwoorden te geven op de onderzoeksvraag. Wij speelden hierop in door voor de onderzoekers ruimte vrij te maken om mee te bewegen en zodoende toch de behoeftes naar boven te halen.   Café Bepp op de Huishoudbeurs Samen met Atlas Leefomgeving voerde TrueTalk haar dialogen door middel van ons agile onderzoeksconcept Café Bepp – individuele dialogen op locatie. Wij bezochten gezamenlijk de Huishoudbeurs 2025 in de RAI Amsterdam, waar wij met Café Bepp ons eigen onderzoeksfaciliteit hadden ingericht. Bij kwalitatief, embedded onderzoek is het creëren van neutraal terrein prioriteit. Daarom kent Café Bepp in de Huishoudbeurs de vorm van een bruin café met tafels die bedekt zijn door een Perzisch kleedje. Dit creëert niet alleen neutraal terrein, maar maakt deelname ook uitnodigend en laagdrempelig. Recruiters nodigden mensen in de aansluitende hal uit voor een gesprek, in ruil voor een kop koffie.   De dag startte met een briefing gesprekstechnieken voor de deelnemende professionals. TrueTalk gaf daarin uitleg over de gespreksleidraad, met tools en gesprekstechnieken voor het voeren van dialogen, en aandachtspunten voor het onderzoek. Elke dialoog werd in tweetallen gevoerd, zodat een persoon zich volledig kon focussen op de dialoog, en de ander zo nauwkeurig mogelijk kon notuleren. De dag werd afgesloten met een wrap-up waarbij we samen de eerste observaties op een rij zetten.

2.2 De aanpak Briefing en voorbereidingen TrueTalk en Atlas Leefomgeving startten het project met een krachtige inhoudelijke briefing, waar wij samen de onderzoeksdoelstellingen, onderzoeksvraag, de locatie en doelgroep bepaalden. Vervolgens organiseerde TrueTalk de logistieke zaken. Wij schreven de gespreksleidraad van het onderzoek, en organiseerden de veldwerkdag in Café Bepp op de Huishoudbeurs. TrueTalk lichtte Atlas Leefomgeving in met een uitnodiging met praktische informatie, en verzorgde alles van eten tot gesprekspartners zodat Atlas Leefomgeving zich volledig kon richten op de inhoud.  Het veldwerk Op maandag 24 februari 2025 deden Atlas Leefomgeving en TrueTalk onderzoek op de Huishoudbeurs in de RAI in Amsterdam. Gedurende de veldwerkdag voerden wij dialogen van 20-40 minuten met mensen van uiteenlopende achtergronden en leeftijden. De doelgroep was als volgt: mensen die nu, in de nabije toekomst of in de afgelopen twee jaar nadenken over, of bezig zijn geweest met verbouwen of verhuizen. De reden voor deze doelgroep is de aanname dat van hen redelijkerwijs verwacht kan worden dat zij behoefte hebben aan informatie over verduurzaming.   De spreiding van  N=44 gesprekspartners:   Spreiding leeftijd:  20-40 jaar:   N= 20 40-60 jaar:   N= 18 60+ jaar:   N= 4 Onbekend:   N= 2  Spreiding gender: Vrouwen:   N= 38 Mannen:   N= 6  De gesprekspartners kwamen uit steden en dorpen in heel Nederland, waaronder: Den Haag, Deventer, Duiven, Groningen, Haarlem, Halsteren, Hazerswoude-Dorp, Huizen, Kampen, Kinderdijk, Lisse, Rotterdam, Sneek en Voorburg.  Analyse, inzichtensessie en aanbevelingen voor het vervolg  Geheel volgens de wetten van kwalitatief marktonderzoek is 100% van de inzichten gebaseerd op wat mensen hebben gezegd en gedaan. TrueTalk heeft de notities van de dialogen geanalyseerd. Tijdens een interne inzichtensessie scherpte het team de resultaten aan en bepaalden wij samen de hoofdlijnen van de inzichten. Vervolgens zijn de definitieve inzichten tijdens de inzichtensessie op woensdag 12 maart met Atlas Leefomgeving gedeeld. Zij had de mogelijkheid deze verder te bevragen, nuanceren en aan te vullen.

3. De inzichten   In dit hoofdstuk worden de inzichten van het onderzoek beschreven. Deze zijn opgedeeld in (1) het overkoepelende hoofdinzicht, (2) de belevingsinzichten die het hoofdinzicht onderbouwen; en (3) feedback vanuit de burger op de tekst die hen is voorgelegd en hoe zij deze graag zou willen zien.  3.1 Het hoofdinzicht  Mensen weten niet wat ze niet weten. Zij begrijpen het belang van (informatie over) de energietransitie maar hebben niet genoeg kennis van het onderwerp om een inhoudelijke informatiebehoefte te verwoorden. Er zijn te veel mogelijkheden en er is te weinig overzicht: door de bomen zien zij het bos niet meer. Hierdoor ervaren zij de wereld van de energietransitie en verduurzaming als ingewikkeld en onduidelijk.   Door het gebrek aan duidelijkheid focussen mensen zich met name op drie drempels. Zowel de kosten van verduurzaming; als mogelijke gevaren van de verduurzamingsopties; en de ontwikkelingen van verduurzamingsopties die later niet meer duurzaam blijken te zijn, zorgen voor waakzaamheid.   Ze hebben dus behoefte aan richting en consistente informatie die aansluit bij hun persoonlijke situatie. Zo willen ze weten welke informatie zij zelf nodig hebben om keuzes te kunnen maken en wat voor informatie wel of niet klopt. Zij vinden het logisch dat de overheid daarin een leidende rol op zich neemt. Hiermee lijken ze een passieve informatiebehoefte te hebben en kaatsen zij de bal terug: in plaats van zelf informatiebehoeften mee te geven, vragen ze de overheid de verantwoordelijkheid te nemen hen te informeren over de juiste en relevante kennis.           
 
Atlas Leefomgeving – De informatiebehoefte van burgers rondom de energietransitie – 2025   10 
3.2 Belevingsinzichten  De volgende vier inzichten beschrijven elk een bepaalde informatiebehoefte. Deze behoeftes komen voort uit de drempels die mensen ervaren.  Mensen hebben behoefte aan richting: zij weten niet genoeg van de energietransitie om daar inhoudelijke vragen over te stellen Ook al lezen de gesprekspartners bij start van elke dialoog een tekst met uitleg over de energietransitie,  hebben zij moeite om te zeggen wat ze over het onderwerp willen weten. Zij reageren met weinig concrete voorbeelden en hebben geholpen vragen nodig om het gesprek te voeren. Ze weten niet genoeg over het onderwerp om inhoudelijk in te gaan op concrete struikelblokken. Ze zijn zoekend.    In de dialogen legden wij verschillende onderwerpen neer rondom verduurzaming van het huis of de buurt. Kenmerkend aan het gebrek aan kennis is dat van alle onderwerpen de buurtbatterij de meeste vragen opriep omdat deze het meest tot de verbeelding sprak. Ten opzichte van andere opties begrijpen mensen makkelijker wat het inhoudt en zien zij een praktische link met hun eigen context, waardoor vragen vanzelf opkomen.   Doordat zij niet genoeg weten, hebben ze behoefte aan richting. Wat is goed om te doen? Wat zijn überhaupt de opties rondom verduurzaming? Hoe kan je er als burger mee aan de slag gaan? Zo wordt bijvoorbeeld gevraagd om een overzicht van zowel duurzame als fossiele brandstoffen met plus- en minpunten, zodat zij meer grip krijgen op het onderwerp. Dit laat zien dat er wel behoefte is naar informatie en dat het onderwerp als belangrijk genoeg wordt ervaren.  Quotes: - “Ik vind het moeilijk om als consument iets te bedenken hiervoor. Voor mijzelf vind ik het geen nieuwe informatie. Het geeft een beetje de vibes van informatie die je leert voor een toets op de middelbare school.” [Wat zou je dan willen weten?] “Wat is het? Wat zijn die fossiele brandstoffen? Wat zijn risico’s hiervan? Hoe krijg je deze energie?” - “Nee, ik heb me niet verdiept in wat wij hebben. Het is een klein dorp en we wonen daar bijna ons hele leven dus we kennen de buurt.” - “Ik zou graag een overzicht willen van alle duurzame energiebronnen en daarbij risico’s en voordelen. Hoeveel keuze heb ik in energievorm?” - “Hier heb je het niet zo maar over. Ik heb me er nooit in verdiept.” - “Ik heb nog nooit van buurtbatterijen gehoord, waterstof ook niet.”  - “De overheid moet hele praktische voorbeelden geven. Wat is fossiele brandstof en wat gaan we met de energietransitie doen?” - “Waar doe je nou goed aan? Welke vragen moet je jezelf stellen?”  - “Wat zijn de opties? Waarom zou je kunnen kiezen voor deze opties?” - “Soms zeggen cijfers ook weer niks. We boeken nu vluchten naar Zuid-Afrika en dan staat er dat er ‘zo veel kilo CO₂’ bij komt kijken. ‘Ja’, denk ik dan. ‘Is dat dan veel of weinig?’ Dus maak meer vergelijkingen. Dan zie je de uitstoot per vlucht, en dat is dan gelijk aan zoveel honderd kilometer met een auto rijden. Dat je een idee hebt hoeveel het is.”

Mensen hebben behoefte aan overzicht van de financiële kosten: geld voelt nu als een drempel De meest genoemde reden voor mensen om niet te verduurzamen is dat het te veel geld kost. O.a. thuisbatterijen en zonnepanelen zouden veel te duur zijn. Anderzijds blijkt dat als mensen wel verduurzamen, zij ook een goedkoper kostenplaatje noemen als motivatie. Verder geldt dat ook op de lange termijn, kosten hoog zouden zijn. Elektrische auto’s zouden bijvoorbeeld vaak reparaties nodig hebben. Bij zonnepanelen zou je jaren in hetzelfde huis moeten wonen voor het winstgevend zou zijn.   Belangrijk hierbij is dat het financiële obstakel niet uitsluit dat mensen verduurzaming waarderen. Velen begrijpen dat het nodig is maar overwegen die stap niet meer te maken door de kosten. Vergelijkbaar waren er ook een aantal mensen die al stappen in verduurzaming hadden gezet, en zich afvroegen wat de beste optie was om hun geld in mogelijke vervolgstappen aan uit te geven. Een gesprekspartner vond bijvoorbeeld dat er veel informatie te vinden was, maar vond het moeilijk hier keuzes in te maken.   Quotes: - “Ik heb gekeken om het gas eraf te halen, maar dat was niet rendabel.” - “ We zijn vooral met duurzaamheid bezig geweest toen we een huis kochten. We dachten na over hoe we ervoor konden zorgen dat het in de toekomst meer waard wordt.” - “Ik wil nooit geen elektrische auto. Je hebt dan hoge wegenbelasting en kapotte accu’s. Dat is hartstikke duur.” - “Wij hebben nu trouwens een variabel energiecontract via de ANWB en we laden de auto op in de daluren en daar houden we geld aan over. Dat scheelt echt heel veel!” - “Ik heb wel eens gedacht aan zonnepanelen, maar ik ben maar alleen en ik hoor van alles over die regelingen. Ik weet het niet. Ik heb geen veertig jaar meer om het af te betalen.” - “ik vind het wel belangrijk voor de wereld. Maar bijvoorbeeld zonnepanelen, het is allemaal zo duur.” - “Heel leuk deze batterijen maar die kosten heel veel geld. Hoe veilig is het om die weer af te breken?” - “Ik vind het een beetje onnodig dat we van het aardgas af moeten. Sinds een jaar hebben wij zonnepanelen, en wat je terugstort moet je betalen. Je jaagt mensen heel erg op kosten.” - “Het [energielabel] was wel belangrijk. Je wilt zo voordelig mogelijk uitkomen want dat helpt met hypotheek. Maar het is energielabel C geworden. Je hebt allerlei wensen, maar dat lukt niet helemaal. We moeten er straks wel wat aan doen om het energielabel te verlagen. We hebben nog geen specifieke ideeën. Ja zonnepanelen, maar dat wordt weer duurder.” - “Thuisbatterijen zijn heel duur.” - “Mijn aannemer had het over isoleren. En dat kost bijna niets dus daar is bijna niet over nagedacht. Een week later was het huis geïsoleerd. Maar meer informatie van de aannemer was gewenst geweest. Het was alleen maar, ‘we gaan isoleren want dat bespaart energie.’” - “We hebben zonnepanelen op het dak. We huren die, want gas wordt te duur.” - “Ik vind elektrisch rijden niks. Geef mij maar wat lawaai. Heb er nooit over nagedacht, het is te duur voor ons.” - “Ons huis is wel gasloos maar ook wij hebben geen zonnepanelen omdat wij niet vinden dat het rendement oplevert. Om nou zonnepanelen te plaatsten, voordat we het eruit hebben..” - “Eigenlijk word je bedonderd, iedereen moest zonnepanelen plaatsen. Dan lees je nu weer over terugleverkosten.”

Mensen hebben behoefte aan consistente informatie: veranderende opvattingen rondom duurzaamheid wekken wantrouwen op  Mensen zien dat wat eerst wordt aangeboden als verduurzamingsoptie, later niet meer duurzaam blijkt te zijn. Hierdoor kijken zij met wantrouwen naar de mogelijkheden en nemen zij de huidige adviezen niet zomaar aan. Sommigen ervaren dat als misleiding. Waar men eerst met subsidies aan een houtkachel werd geholpen, worden ze nu voor diezelfde kachel extra belast. Zij ervaren dit als oneerlijk en frustrerend. Andere voorbeelden zijn elektrische auto’s waarvan de accuproductie niet duurzaam blijkt te zijn, en de onverwachte terugleverkosten van zonnepanelen.   In andere woorden: mensen hebben behoefte aan consistente informatie. Zij zijn waakzaam geworden op duurzaamheidstrends en zoeken houvast. Hoe weten zij zeker dat de huidige adviezen over een paar jaar nog steeds zullen gelden? En hoe weten zij welke opties zij kunnen vertrouwen?    Quotes: - “Ik heb zelf wel heel veel nagedacht over zonnepanelen bijvoorbeeld, maar dan hoor je weer: ‘je mag het hier niet opslaan’. Eerst kreeg je er subsidie voor en daarna niet meer.” - “De buren hebben met subsidie een houtkachel gekocht en nu geeft dat opeens te veel CO₂ uitstoot.  Ik denk dat Nederland te vooruitstrevend is en dat we te snel willen gaan. Dit gaat veel te snel in vergelijking met de rest van Europa. Energieneutraal in 2050, nou dat gaat echt niet gebeuren.” - “Verkopers aan de deur, daarvan denk ik: ‘jullie doen het alleen voor jezelf.’ Ik zou er op een andere manier naar luisteren als de informatie van de overheid komt.” - “Bijvoorbeeld de elektrische auto, die gaat kapot. Weegt dat op tegen benzine bijvoorbeeld? Niet iedere verandering is een verbetering. En windmolens, wat is het effect op het zeeleven of op vogels? Zijn die wel goed voor het milieu?” - “Dan is dit weer goed en dan weer dat. Het is goed om duidelijk te maken dat het een lopend proces is. Wij hebben verbouwd een jaar geleden, het is een huis uit 1950. Nu staat het vocht op de ramen, dus moeten we nu weer ventileren en dus weer harder stoken? Wanneer doe je het nou goed? We hadden roosters moeten hebben, dat wordt er niet bij verteld. Zulke bedrijven hebben een verdienmodel.” - “Het is leuk de energietransitie maar ze moeten het wel aankunnen. Daar bedoel ik mee: de zonnepanelen, dan heb je ze liggen en dan moet je een boete betalen. Ik heb ook zonnepanelen, die zijn al lang afbetaald daar niet van. Ik ben toentertijd een C1’tje gaan rijden. Daar hoefde je geen wegenbelasting voor te betalen maar een half jaar later wel. Het voelt alsof je er wordt ingeluisd. Zeven jaar terug was ik de enige met zonnepanelen, maar nu heb je het gevoel dat je wordt afgestraft met die terugleverkosten. Dan probeer ik duurzaam te zijn en mijn steentje bij te dragen, en nu word je erop afgestraft.” - “Ik vraag me dus wel echt af: is de elektrische auto nou echt zo veel beter voor het milieu?”

Mensen hebben behoefte aan informatie over de gevaren: zij zijn waakzaam voor de risico’s Veel mensen slaan aan op de mogelijke gevaren die bij verduurzaming komen kijken. Denk aan brandgevaar bij de buurtbatterijen, accu’s en waterstof. Op een vergelijkbare manier slaan mensen aan op de gevaren voor hun gezondheid wanneer ze praten over schadelijke energiebronnen. Zij maken zich zorgen om vervuiling van lokale fabrieken en wat dit voor hen betekent.  Mensen willen begrijpen wat daadwerkelijk gevaarlijk is, en wat niet. Hoe kunnen verschillende verduurzamingsopties hun veiligheid beïnvloeden en hoe verschilt dit met de huidige context? Maar ook heel praktisch: waar moeten zij rekening mee houden wanneer ze verduurzamen?   Als de risico’s meevallen en voorzieningen op een veilige afstand worden geplaatst, vinden zij het echter geen probleem dat deze er komen. Het is vooral de onwetendheid die knaagt.  Quotes: - “En al die batterijen. Lithium is gevaarlijk. Ik wil ook geen zonnepanelen, want die zijn ook brandgevaarlijk.” - “Waar ik mij wel zorgen over maak is de chemische fabriek in de buurt en of dat nou echt leidt tot meer kankergevallen. Dus daar ben ik wel benieuwd naar het kankeronderzoek over die fabrieken. En gevaren anders dan de fabriek ben ik niet echt mee bezig. Alleen als bijv. die buurtbatterij recht voor mijn deur in mijn mooie uitzicht komt, dan zou ik het wel willen weten.” - “Je hoort ook zoveel dingen, net als die elektriciteit die dan gaat branden. Je kan ook batterijen in je huis neerzetten, maar als er dan wat gebeurt zoals brand, dan heb je een probleem. Dus niet alleen leuke informatie maar ook minder leuke informatie over de branden is belangrijk. Ik snap dat het beter is voor het milieu.” - “Ik woonde aan de Botlek, we hebben binnen gezeten met een zwavelvergiftiging. We woonden naast de Shell.” - “Heel leuk deze batterijen maar die kosten heel veel geld, hoe veilig is het dan om die weer af te breken?” - “Ik zou het wel fijn vinden om te weten wat de kans is dat dit ontploft. Ik woon bijvoorbeeld naast een tankstation, ik vraag het me nu echt wel af.” - “Ik vind het milieuvervuiling. ik vind dat niet mooi. ik weet wel dat ze datacenters gebruiken met oude accu’s, maar de capaciteit wordt minder en accu’s kunnen ook zelf ontbranden. Dat vind ik niet veilig. Bij ons bij de sloop vliegen ze ook vaak in brand.” - “Ohja, je hebt ketels die op waterstof kunnen. Ja.. Als die maar kan branden, dan maakt het niet zoveel uit. Waterstof is wel gevaarlijk geloof ik. Er komt heel veel druk vrij bij de opslag.” - “Volgens mij wordt er een buurtbatterij bij ons in de buurt geplaatst. Dan denk ik, dat hoef ik niet bij mij in de buurt te hebben. Ook windmolens, dat hoeft bij mij niet in een woonwijk. Je krijgt er slagschaduw van, en deeltjes die toch kunnen uitwaaien. Dat hoeft  bij mij niet in de achtertuin, dat is wat ik erover denk.” - “Ik mis de informatie van de kerncentrales. Ik ben zelf een beetje bang voor nog een Tsjernobyl.”

3.3 Feedback op de tekst  Naast de belevingsinzichten hebben de gesprekspartners ook feedback gegeven op de tekst die hen werd voorgelegd aan het begin van de dialoog. Hieronder staan drie punten van feedback beschreven.    Het taalgebruik van de tekst is begrijpelijk Vrijwel niemand geeft aan moeite te hebben met de begrijpelijkheid van de tekst. Zij lezen de tekst gemakkelijk door. Zij stellen geen hulpvragen om het beter te begrijpen, maar reageren gelijk op de inhoud. Het taalgebruik sluit goed aan op de doelgroep en heeft geen verdere aanscherping nodig.   Quotes: - “Soms gebruiken ze zulke termen op websites dat je Google ervoor nodig hebt. Begrijpelijke termen zijn nodig voor mensen die minder technisch zijn. In deze tekst zie ik niets dat stoort.”  - “Oké, leuk en interessant onderwerp.” - “Deze info is voor iedereen. Voor bewoners in een buurt maar het is ook voor je algemene kennis.” - “Ik vind het op zich wel duidelijk.”      
 
Atlas Leefomgeving – De informatiebehoefte van burgers rondom de energietransitie – 2025   15 
Het is onduidelijk waar de tekst heen gaat Mensen die verduurzamingsgezind zijn, zijn zoekend naar de doelstelling van de tekst. Zij vinden de tekst weliswaar begrijpelijk, maar vinden de doelstelling niet duidelijk. Zij zoeken een verbinding met de volgende praktische stappen. Wetende wat de energietransitie is, wat moeten zij er dan mee? Welke concrete acties kunnen zij ondernemen? Waar begin je en hoe ziet het proces eruit? Denk aan meer informatie over specifieke vormen van verduurzaming, een overzicht van de verschillen tussen energiebronnen en praktische stappenplannen die aansluiten op hun situatie.   Quotes: - “Ik mis een beetje de link. Ik snap dat duurzame energie belangrijk is, maar ik mis de link met wat nieuwe energiebronnen zijn. Misschien een lijstje met fossiele energiebronnen, nieuwe energiebronnen en nieuwe duurzame energiebronnen. Maar ook weer niet te veel want dan wordt het weer te moeilijk. Ik wil wat meer context. Zoals met waterstof, water raakt toch ook op?” - “Het is prettig dat het kort en krachtige informatie is. Het is erg basaal, opgebouwd in informatie die ik wel ken en daarna in op de diepgang. Dat vind ik fijn. Het is duidelijke informatie. Fijn ook dat er voorbeelden zijn, dat maakt het tastbaar.” - “Ik vraag mij af waar deze informatie eigenlijk naar toeging, dus dat we gaan kijken naar de alternatieven? Wat wil je met deze informatie? Dat vind ik onduidelijk. Wil jij mij overtuigen of informeren of iets anders?”  - “Ik vind het moeilijk om als consument iets te bedenken hiervoor. Voor mijzelf vind ik het geen nieuwe informatie. Het geeft een beetje de vibes van informatie die je leert voor een toets op de middelbare school.” [Wat zou je dan willen weten?] “Wat is het? Wat zijn die fossiele brandstoffen? Wat zijn risico’s hiervan? Hoe krijg je deze energie.” - “Ik denk dat als ik er meer over zou willen weten, dat de tekst dan wel heel kort is. Waar en op welke manier kunnen we er voor zorgen? Ik zou meer over het waarom en de veilige manier willen weten. Welke stappen gaan we nu nemen om daar te komen?” - “Liever meer informatie gericht op de persoon zelf, het is nu abstract. Hoe is het voor jou als persoon beter in plaats van dat er staat waarom het voor het milieu beter is. Ik zou het fijn vinden als het bijvoorbeeld vriendelijk is voor je portemonnee of dat het beter is voor mijn leefkwaliteit.”

Het helpt om de inhoud visueel te maken Om de tekst interessanter en begrijpelijker te maken, en ervoor te zorgen dat mensen aandachtig naar de inhoud kijken, zou het voor veel mensen helpen om de informatie visueel te maken. Dit biedt meer context, maakt de inhoud duidelijk, en helpt met het verduidelijken van de praktische stappen van verduurzaming.   Mensen geven voorbeelden voor de website zoals het toevoegen van plaatjes, en zeggen dat het nuttig zou zijn om filmpjes te maken en deze via social media te verspreiden.  Quotes: - “Ik denk dat filmpjes beter werken dan tekst in deze huidige tijd. Visueel werkt beter om straight to the point naar duidelijke informatie te gaan.” - “Op een website zou ik het visueler maken.”  - “Het moet met plaatjes. Mensen die het zoeken, willen wel lezen. Maar mensen moeten het ervaren. Denk aan een game of een escape room.” - “Op een website zie je dan ook foto’s, dat helpt wel meer. Op een website verwacht ik dan groene kleuren. Ik weet niet of ik filmpjes zou kijken. Misschien juist wel iets met grote windmolens omdat je dan denkt ‘daar wil ik meer over weten.” - “De korte animatiefilmpjes zijn wel de visuele tool. Het is kort en krachtig en dat is fijn.” - “Op een mobiel hoeft het geen kort filmpje te zijn. Maar zonder moeilijke termen. Na tien, vijftien minuten wordt het langdradig.”  - “Misschien moet het wel aantrekkelijker met meer plaatjes. Ik ben een beelddenker. Het moet aantrekkelijker worden gemaakt voor mij om de tekst vast te houden. Het is dat ik nu bij jullie zit maar anders had ik het niet gelezen.” - “Een video kan, maar lezen is ook nuttig. Het ligt er per persoon aan. Instagram, reclame op Instagram, dat heeft iedereen en dan ben je al bezig met visuele dingen.” - “ik vind het zelf leuk om video’s te kijken. Ik ben zelf beeldgericht. dus als je bijvoorbeeld iets ziet, iets doet, dan geeft het een voorbeeld. Als je visueel kan laten zien hoe iemand het doet, bijvoorbeeld een nieuwe manier, dat je het leuk maakt om geld te besparen.”

Over TrueTalk  TrueTalk helpt organisaties met onderzoek en dialoog. Ons wapen? Het echte gesprek. Zie www.truetalk.nl.    We werken in vier pijlers:   1. Het agile onderzoeksconcept Café Bepp wordt ingezet om samen doelgroepen te ontdekken, concepten te toetsen en producten aan te scherpen. Café Bepp opent het liefst op plekken waar de doelgroep in zijn/haar natuurlijke gedrag is. Hoe puurder hoe beter. Daarmee is Café Bepp een passende onderzoekstool om op alle momenten binnen het innovatie- en marketingtraject. 2. We bouwen onderzoekslabs om structureel inzichten op te doen. Denk aan het opzetten van programma’s en het trainen van vaardigheden. TrueTalk helpt organisaties zoals KPN en A.Vogel in het (uit-)bouwen van een eigen kracht.  3. We versterken de mensgerichte cultuur. Want alle moderne tools ten spijt, een dialoog is de beste manier om aan klantgerichte cultuur te werken. We praten niet over, maar met mensen. 4. TrueTalk helpt in de samenwerking tussen stakeholders. Wij scheiden de belangen van de stellingen door te onderzoeken en te luisteren. Vervolgens werken wij met alle partijen naar oplossingen. We betrekken iedereen, ook mensen die minder zichtbaar zijn.  TrueTalk werkt voor corporates en startups, marketing- en innovatieteams. Denk aan het Ministerie van Algemene Zaken, KPN, het Ministerie van Sociale Zaken en ABN Amro.

Bijlage: Informatiebehoefte  Deze bijlage omvat concrete vragen die de gesprekspartners in de dialogen van dit onderzoek gesteld hebben. Deze zijn opgedeeld in vragen omtrent de verduurzaming van het huis; en vragen omtrent de verduurzaming van de buurt.   Informatiebehoefte ten aanzien van het huis  - “Hoe moet je verduurzamen?”  - “Moet ik aan de gang met de isolatie of de warmtepomp?”   - “Waar kan je batterijen inleveren? En waar kan je een accu weggooien?”  - “Maakt het uit hoe oud mijn huis is voor zonnepanelen? En vloerverwarming?”  - “Wat is de beste optie qua verwarming en airco? Wij denken aan vloerverwarming en een palletkachel.”   - “Lithiumbatterijen, die zitten toch ook in fietsen?”  - “Wat is goed om te doen? Welke vraag moet je jezelf stellen om het goed te doen?”  - “Waar plaats je thuisaccu’s? Bij ons kwam het in de hal door de leidingen.”  - “Je moet wel van die brandstoffen af, voor het milieu. Zijn we daar niet al te laat mee?”  - “Kan er meer informatie komen over de regelingen per verwarmingsoptie? Welke subsidies er zijn en wat ik kan doen.”  - “Ik zou wel willen weten of het moeilijker is om zonnepanelen te blussen als je die op je woning hebt.”  - ""Hoe kan ik hier beter van worden? Hoe kunnen we geld besparen?”  - “Bijvoorbeeld de elektrische auto, die gaat kapot. Weegt dat op tegen benzine bijvoorbeeld? Niet iedere verandering is een verbetering. En windmolens, wat is het effect op het zeeleven of op vogels? Zijn die wel goed voor het milieu?”  - “Geef uitgebreidere informatie over de context van gas.”  - “Er is te veel onduidelijkheid over wat goed en niet goed is. Van het aardgas afgaan is goed, maar kerncentrales zijn ook gevaarlijk. Waarom doen we dat niet? Wat zijn de risico’s?”   
Atlas Leefomgeving – De informatiebehoefte van burgers rondom de energietransitie – 2025   19 
- “Bij gas kan je de gaskraan dichtdraaien, kan dat ook bij waterstof?”  - “Ik vraag me dus wel echt af: is de elektrische auto nou echt zo veel beter voor het milieu?”  - “De overheid moet hele praktische voorbeelden geven. Wat is fossiele brandstof en wat gaan we met de energietransitie doen?”  - “Ja ik vraag me ook af met die elektrische auto’s waar de accu’s uiteindelijk naartoe gaan. Maar ik denk ook dat ik het niet wil weten.”   - “Wat is het meest gunstig qua energie?”  - “Ik vind het lastig om uit te zoeken waar je nou subsidie voor krijgt. Soms is het zo duur en ingewikkeld, dat het het eigenlijk niet meer waard is om zoiets te doen.”  - “Ik zou graag een overzicht willen van alle duurzame energiebronnen en daarbij risico’s en voordelen. Hoeveel keuze heb ik in energievorm?”  - “Sommige mensen denken dat als je onder zonnepanelen slaapt dat je straling krijgt, terwijl daar geen wetenschappelijk onderzoek voor is. Ik zou die feitelijke informatie rondom de veiligheid van deze ontwikkelingen willen weten.”  Informatiebehoefte ten aanzien van de buurt  - “Als ik naar woningen kijk, kijk ik altijd op Google naar wat er is. Tankstations, snelwegen, fabrieken  en ov bijvoorbeeld.”  - “Buurtbatterijen en waterstof zijn me onbekend. En hoe doen we het dan met de CO₂-uitstoot?”  - “Ik heb wel ervaring met van die batterijen, en ik weet dat als je batterijen gebruikt het grootste risico is dat als je het laat vallen, je dan een imbalans krijgt. Dus bij buurtbatterijen moet je kijken naar welke kant de wind opstaat.”   - “Wat gebeurt er met een buurtbatterij als er bliksem inslaat?”  - “Ja ik wil wel wat weten over de risico’s van de buurtbatterij. Maar ook van die elektriciteitshuisjes.”  - “Ik zou informatie over de buurt heel belangrijk vinden, toch voor je gevoel van veiligheid. Ik weet niet veel van waterstof. Wordt dat niet in Frankrijk gebruikt in energiecentrales? En ammoniak vervoeren, ja dat zou ik toch wel eng vinden.”   
Atlas Leefomgeving – De informatiebehoefte van burgers rondom de energietransitie – 2025   20 
- “Windmolens hebben slagschaduw, en volgens mij komt daar plastic vanaf of iets anders. Is dat schadelijk? Wat doet dat?”  - “Stadswarmte, kan je dat weigeren? Wat zijn de risico’s?”  - “Hoe moet je zo’n buurtbatterij veilig maken en houden? Daar staan zo veel vraagtekens omheen dat het voor heel veel mensen moeilijk is om te bedenken van ‘laten we die kant op gaan.”  - “Met waterstof zijn ze al best ver en ik vind dat een mooie optie om mee door te gaan in de toekomst. Ik zou willen dat de overheid meer daadkracht daarin toont.”  - “Wat gaat het me brengen? Een zeecontainer midden op een grasveld, wat levert mij dat op als huishouden?”  - “Ik mis informatie van de impact als we het niet doen. Wat is de impact als we het niet doen, voor jou en je buurt?”  - “En waterstof? Kunnen auto’s op waterstof?”  - “Ik zou het wel fijn vinden om te weten wat de kans is dat dit ontploft. Ik woon bijvoorbeeld naast een tankstation, ik vraag het me nu echt wel af.”  - “Wat zijn de opties? Waarom zou je kunnen kiezen voor deze opties? Ik mis de informaties van de kerncentrales. Ik ben zelf nog een beetje bang voor Tsjernobyl.”  - “Welke stappen moeten we zetten om te verduurzamen?”  - “Ik zou het prettig vinden als gemeenten vanuit zichzelf deelden waarom ze bepaalde dingen doen of wat zij doen voor deze energietransitie. Ik vraag me ook soms af, waarom hebben de meeste overheidsgebouwen geen zonnepanelen?.”  - “Dat hele CO₂ gebeuren is nattevingerwerk. Waarom moet dit kleine kutlandje alles oplossen?”  - “Heel leuk deze batterijen maar die kosten heel veel geld, hoe veilig is het dan om die weer af te breken?”  - “Ik wil meer weten over windmolens en zonnepanelen. Zonnepanelen is voor iedereen makkelijk. Deze informatie is meer ver van je bed.”  - “Het is fijn om te weten als je naast een risico-object woont.”  - “Buurtbatterijen, staan die in de buurt of verderop?” ",6118,3043,49.73847662634848,39448,"Rapportage energiebehoefte burgers rondom energietransitie Leefomgeving 19 maart, 2025 Leefomgeving – informatiebehoefte burgers rondom energietransitie – 2025 2 Colofon Onderzoek uitgevoerd opdracht Ministerie Infrastructuur Waterstaat.

Bij soort semi-exploratieve vraagstukken kwalitatief onderzoek tussen vrijwel aangewezen methode leren belevingswereld, behoeftes emoties burgers. In wereld Design Thinking heet ‘Empathy’. Wij faciliteerden directe, laagdrempelige menselijke dialogen open karakter, waarbij burgers spraken eerder onderzoek hadden meegedaan. personen makkelijk woorden komen redenen moeilijker bereikbaar zijn. Empathy kwalitatief onderzoek gaven mogelijkheid echte gesprek hen echt begrijpen. Dialogen diverse groep gesprekspartners betekent uiteenlopende verhalen, ervaringen informatiebehoeftes. koos daarom open dialoogvorm plaats strakke interviews. Kenmerkend interviews vragenlijst leidend is, onderzoeker weinig ruimte overblijft mee bewegen onderwerpen gesprekspartners belangrijk zijn. In dialoog daarentegen, iedereen daadwerkelijk kwijt kwijt willen. Zo natuurlijk gesprek ontstaan waarbij echte verhaal verteld wordt. stelt dialoog onderzoeker staat gesprekspartners vertellen, ontstaat mogelijkheid diepte gaan.

Zij mogelijkheid verder bevragen, nuanceren vullen. Leefomgeving – informatiebehoefte burgers rondom energietransitie – 2025 9 3. inzichten In hoofdstuk inzichten onderzoek beschreven. opgedeeld (1) overkoepelende hoofdinzicht, (2) belevingsinzichten hoofdinzicht onderbouwen; (3) feedback vanuit burger tekst hen voorgelegd graag zien. 3.1 hoofdinzicht Mensen weten. Zij begrijpen belang (informatie over) energietransitie genoeg kennis onderwerp inhoudelijke informatiebehoefte verwoorden. Er mogelijkheden weinig overzicht: bomen bos meer. Hierdoor ervaren wereld energietransitie verduurzaming ingewikkeld onduidelijk. Door gebrek duidelijkheid focussen name drie drempels. Zowel kosten verduurzaming; mogelijke gevaren verduurzamingsopties; ontwikkelingen verduurzamingsopties later duurzaam blijken zijn, zorgen waakzaamheid. behoefte richting consistente informatie aansluit persoonlijke situatie. Zo welke informatie keuzes maken informatie klopt. Zij vinden logisch overheid daarin leidende rol neemt. Hiermee lijken passieve informatiebehoefte kaatsen bal terug: plaats informatiebehoeften mee geven, overheid verantwoordelijkheid nemen hen informeren juiste relevante kennis. Leefomgeving – informatiebehoefte burgers rondom energietransitie – 2025 10 3.2 Belevingsinzichten volgende vier inzichten beschrijven elk bepaalde informatiebehoefte. behoeftes komen voort drempels ervaren. Mensen behoefte richting: genoeg energietransitie inhoudelijke stellen lezen gesprekspartners start elke dialoog tekst uitleg energietransitie, moeite zeggen onderwerp weten. Zij reageren weinig concrete voorbeelden geholpen gesprek voeren. genoeg onderwerp inhoudelijk concrete struikelblokken. zoekend. In dialogen legden onderwerpen neer rondom verduurzaming huis buurt. Kenmerkend gebrek kennis alle onderwerpen buurtbatterij meeste opriep meest verbeelding sprak. Ten opzichte opties begrijpen makkelijker inhoudt praktische link eigen context, waardoor vanzelf opkomen. Doordat genoeg weten, behoefte richting. goed doen? überhaupt opties rondom verduurzaming? Hoe burger mee slag gaan? Zo gevraagd overzicht zowel duurzame fossiele brandstoffen plus- minpunten, zodat grip krijgen onderwerp. laat behoefte informatie onderwerp belangrijk genoeg ervaren. Quotes: - “Ik vind moeilijk consument bedenken hiervoor. mijzelf vind nieuwe informatie. geeft beetje vibes informatie leert toets middelbare school.” [Wat weten?] “Wat het? fossiele brandstoffen? risico’s hiervan? Hoe krijg energie?” - “Nee, verdiept hebben. klein dorp wonen bijna hele leven kennen buurt.” - “Ik graag overzicht alle duurzame energiebronnen daarbij risico’s voordelen. Hoeveel keuze energievorm?” - “Hier over. nooit verdiept.” - “Ik nooit buurtbatterijen gehoord, waterstof niet.” - “De overheid hele praktische voorbeelden geven. fossiele brandstof energietransitie doen?” - “Waar doe nou goed aan? Welke jezelf stellen?” - “Wat opties? Waarom kiezen opties?” - “Soms zeggen cijfers weer niks. We boeken vluchten Zuid-Afrika staat ‘zo kilo CO₂’ kijken. ‘Ja’, denk dan. ‘Is weinig?’ Dus maak vergelijkingen. Dan zie uitstoot vlucht, gelijk zoveel honderd kilometer auto rijden. idee hebt hoeveel is.” Leefomgeving – informatiebehoefte burgers rondom energietransitie – 2025 11 Mensen behoefte overzicht financiële kosten: geld voelt drempel meest genoemde reden verduurzamen geld kost. O.a. thuisbatterijen zonnepanelen zouden duur zijn. Anderzijds blijkt verduurzamen, goedkoper kostenplaatje noemen motivatie. Verder geldt lange termijn, kosten hoog zouden zijn. Elektrische auto’s zouden reparaties hebben. Bij zonnepanelen jaren hetzelfde huis wonen winstgevend zijn. Belangrijk hierbij financiële obstakel uitsluit verduurzaming waarderen. Velen begrijpen overwegen stap maken kosten. Vergelijkbaar aantal stappen verduurzaming hadden gezet, afvroegen beste optie geld mogelijke vervolgstappen geven. gesprekspartner vond informatie vinden was, vond moeilijk keuzes maken. Quotes: - “Ik gekeken gas eraf halen, rendabel.” - “ We vooral duurzaamheid bezig huis kochten. We dachten ervoor konden zorgen toekomst waard wordt.” - “Ik nooit elektrische auto. Je hebt hoge wegenbelasting kapotte accu’s. hartstikke duur.” - “Wij trouwens variabel energiecontract via ANWB laden auto daluren houden geld over. scheelt echt veel!” - “Ik gedacht zonnepanelen, hoor regelingen. weet niet. veertig jaar af betalen.” - “ik vind belangrijk wereld. Maar zonnepanelen, allemaal duur.” - “Heel leuk batterijen kosten geld. Hoe veilig weer af breken?” - “Ik vind beetje onnodig aardgas af moeten. Sinds jaar zonnepanelen, terugstort betalen. Je jaagt erg kosten.” - “Het [energielabel] belangrijk. Je wilt voordelig uitkomen helpt hypotheek. Maar energielabel C geworden. Je hebt allerlei wensen, lukt helemaal. We straks energielabel verlagen. We specifieke ideeën. Ja zonnepanelen, weer duurder.” - “Thuisbatterijen duur.” - “Mijn aannemer isoleren. En kost bijna bijna nagedacht. week later huis geïsoleerd. Maar informatie aannemer gewenst geweest. maar, ‘we isoleren bespaart energie.’” - “We zonnepanelen dak. We huren die, gas duur.” - “Ik vind elektrisch rijden niks. Geef lawaai. Heb nooit nagedacht, duur ons.” - “Ons huis gasloos zonnepanelen vinden rendement oplevert. Om nou zonnepanelen plaatsten, voordat eruit hebben..” - “Eigenlijk word bedonderd, iedereen moest zonnepanelen plaatsen. Dan lees weer terugleverkosten.” Leefomgeving – informatiebehoefte burgers rondom energietransitie – 2025 12 Mensen behoefte consistente informatie: veranderende opvattingen rondom duurzaamheid wekken wantrouwen Mensen eerst aangeboden verduurzamingsoptie, later duurzaam blijkt zijn. Hierdoor kijken wantrouwen mogelijkheden nemen huidige adviezen zomaar aan. Sommigen ervaren misleiding. Waar eerst subsidies houtkachel geholpen, diezelfde kachel extra belast. Zij ervaren oneerlijk frustrerend. Andere voorbeelden elektrische auto’s waarvan accuproductie duurzaam blijkt zijn, onverwachte terugleverkosten zonnepanelen. In woorden: behoefte consistente informatie. Zij waakzaam geworden duurzaamheidstrends zoeken houvast. Hoe zeker huidige adviezen paar jaar steeds zullen gelden? En welke opties vertrouwen? Quotes: - “Ik nagedacht zonnepanelen bijvoorbeeld, hoor weer: ‘je mag opslaan’. Eerst kreeg subsidie daarna meer.” - “De buren subsidie houtkachel gekocht geeft opeens CO₂ uitstoot. denk Nederland vooruitstrevend snel gaan. gaat snel vergelijking rest Europa. Energieneutraal 2050, nou gaat echt gebeuren.” - “Verkopers deur, daarvan denk ik: ‘jullie jezelf.’ manier luisteren informatie overheid komt.” - “Bijvoorbeeld elektrische auto, gaat kapot. Weegt benzine bijvoorbeeld? Niet iedere verandering verbetering. En windmolens, effect zeeleven vogels? Zijn goed milieu?” - “Dan weer goed weer dat. goed duidelijk maken lopend proces is. Wij verbouwd jaar geleden, huis 1950. Nu staat vocht ramen, weer ventileren weer harder stoken? Wanneer doe nou goed? We hadden roosters hebben, verteld. Zulke bedrijven verdienmodel.” - “Het leuk energietransitie aankunnen. Daar bedoel mee: zonnepanelen, liggen boete betalen. zonnepanelen, lang afbetaald van. toentertijd C1’tje rijden. Daar hoefde wegenbelasting betalen half jaar later wel. voelt alsof ingeluisd. Zeven jaar terug enige zonnepanelen, gevoel afgestraft terugleverkosten. Dan probeer duurzaam steentje dragen, word erop afgestraft.” - “Ik vraag echt af: elektrische auto nou echt beter milieu?” Leefomgeving – informatiebehoefte burgers rondom energietransitie – 2025 13 Mensen behoefte informatie gevaren: waakzaam risico’s Veel slaan mogelijke gevaren verduurzaming komen kijken. Denk brandgevaar buurtbatterijen, accu’s waterstof. Op vergelijkbare manier slaan gevaren gezondheid wanneer praten schadelijke energiebronnen. Zij maken zorgen vervuiling lokale fabrieken hen betekent. Mensen begrijpen daadwerkelijk gevaarlijk is, niet. Hoe verduurzamingsopties veiligheid beïnvloeden verschilt huidige context? Maar praktisch: rekening mee houden wanneer verduurzamen? Als risico’s meevallen voorzieningen veilige afstand geplaatst, vinden echter probleem komen. vooral onwetendheid knaagt. Quotes: - “En batterijen. Lithium gevaarlijk. zonnepanelen, brandgevaarlijk.” - “Waar zorgen maak chemische fabriek buurt nou echt leidt kankergevallen. Dus benieuwd kankeronderzoek fabrieken. En gevaren anders fabriek echt mee bezig. Alleen bijv. buurtbatterij recht deur mooie uitzicht komt, weten.” - “Je hoort zoveel dingen, net elektriciteit gaat branden. Je batterijen huis neerzetten, gebeurt brand, probleem. Dus leuke informatie leuke informatie branden belangrijk. snap beter milieu.” - “Ik woonde Botlek, binnen gezeten zwavelvergiftiging. We woonden naast Shell.” - “Heel leuk batterijen kosten geld, veilig weer af breken?” - “Ik fijn vinden kans ontploft. woon naast tankstation, vraag echt af.” - “Ik vind milieuvervuiling. vind mooi. weet datacenters gebruiken oude accu’s, capaciteit accu’s ontbranden. vind veilig. Bij sloop vliegen brand.” - “Ohja, hebt ketels waterstof kunnen. Ja.. Als branden, maakt zoveel uit. Waterstof gevaarlijk geloof ik. Er druk vrij opslag.” - “Volgens buurtbatterij buurt geplaatst. Dan denk ik, hoef buurt hebben. windmolens, hoeft woonwijk. Je krijgt slagschaduw van, deeltjes uitwaaien. hoeft achtertuin, erover denk.” - “Ik mis informatie kerncentrales. beetje bang Tsjernobyl.” Leefomgeving – informatiebehoefte burgers rondom energietransitie – 2025 14 3.3 Feedback tekst Naast belevingsinzichten gesprekspartners feedback gegeven tekst hen voorgelegd begin dialoog. Hieronder staan drie punten feedback beschreven. taalgebruik tekst begrijpelijk Vrijwel niemand geeft moeite begrijpelijkheid tekst. Zij lezen tekst gemakkelijk door. Zij stellen hulpvragen beter begrijpen, reageren gelijk inhoud. taalgebruik sluit goed doelgroep verdere aanscherping nodig. Quotes: - “Soms gebruiken zulke termen websites Google ervoor hebt. Begrijpelijke termen technisch zijn. In tekst zie stoort.” - “Oké, leuk interessant onderwerp.” - “Deze info iedereen. bewoners buurt algemene kennis.” - “Ik vind duidelijk.” Leefomgeving – informatiebehoefte burgers rondom energietransitie – 2025 15 onduidelijk tekst heen gaat Mensen verduurzamingsgezind zijn, zoekend doelstelling tekst. Zij vinden tekst weliswaar begrijpelijk, vinden doelstelling duidelijk. Zij zoeken verbinding volgende praktische stappen. Wetende energietransitie is, mee? Welke concrete acties ondernemen? Waar begin ziet proces eruit? Denk informatie specifieke vormen verduurzaming, overzicht verschillen tussen energiebronnen praktische stappenplannen aansluiten situatie. Quotes: - “Ik mis beetje link. snap duurzame energie belangrijk is, mis link nieuwe energiebronnen zijn. Misschien lijstje fossiele energiebronnen, nieuwe energiebronnen nieuwe duurzame energiebronnen. Maar weer weer moeilijk. context. Zoals waterstof, water raakt op?” - “Het prettig kort krachtige informatie is. erg basaal, opgebouwd informatie ken daarna diepgang. vind fijn. duidelijke informatie. Fijn voorbeelden zijn, maakt tastbaar.” - “Ik vraag af informatie eigenlijk toeging, kijken alternatieven? informatie? vind onduidelijk. Wil jij overtuigen informeren anders?” - “Ik vind moeilijk consument bedenken hiervoor. mijzelf vind nieuwe informatie. geeft beetje vibes informatie leert toets middelbare school.” [Wat weten?] “Wat het? fossiele brandstoffen? risico’s hiervan? Hoe krijg energie.” - “Ik denk weten, tekst kort is. Waar welke manier zorgen? veilige manier weten. Welke stappen nemen komen?” - “Liever informatie gericht persoon zelf, abstract. Hoe jou persoon beter plaats staat milieu beter is. fijn vinden vriendelijk portemonnee beter leefkwaliteit.” Leefomgeving – informatiebehoefte burgers rondom energietransitie – 2025 16 helpt inhoud visueel maken Om tekst interessanter begrijpelijker maken, ervoor zorgen aandachtig inhoud kijken, helpen informatie visueel maken. biedt context, maakt inhoud duidelijk, helpt verduidelijken praktische stappen verduurzaming. Mensen voorbeelden website toevoegen plaatjes, zeggen nuttig filmpjes maken via social media verspreiden. Quotes: - “Ik denk filmpjes beter werken tekst huidige tijd. Visueel werkt beter straight point duidelijke informatie gaan.” - “Op website visueler maken.” - “Het plaatjes. Mensen zoeken, lezen. Maar ervaren. Denk game escape room.” - “Op website zie foto’s, helpt meer. Op website verwacht groene kleuren. weet filmpjes kijken. Misschien juist grote windmolens denkt ‘daar weten.” - “De korte animatiefilmpjes visuele tool. kort krachtig fijn.” - “Op mobiel hoeft kort filmpje zijn. Maar moeilijke termen. Na tien, vijftien minuten langdradig.” - “Misschien aantrekkelijker plaatjes. beelddenker. aantrekkelijker gemaakt tekst vast houden. jullie zit anders gelezen.” - “Een video kan, lezen nuttig. ligt persoon aan.

 VOORWOORD  
Energietransitie. Een woord dat op ieders lippen ligt. Nederland moet ‘van het gas af ’. Forse 
ingrepen  en miljardeninvesteringen zijn nodig . Zorg en onrust nemen toe. D e transitie  gaat niet 
vanzelf. En nu Nederland een zware cris is met grote economische gevolgen doormaakt,  zullen de 
kosten van de energietransitie nog zwaarder gaan wegen. K unnen we dit wel betalen? Wat is 
verstandig om te  doen?  
Vereniging Energie -Nederland, de branchevereniging van energiebedrijven en één van de 
ondertekenaars van het klimaatakkoord , voelt het als haar maatschappelijke plicht een 
voortrekkersrol te vervullen en het debat over de energietransitie te faciliteren. Zo is te lezen in de 
strategie Koers 2022 . De consument staat hier in centraal.  
Is het mogelijk hobbels weg te nemen en de transitie met name in de gebouwde omgeving soepeler 
te laten verlopen? Zijn er mogelijkheden om de burger te ontlasten? Te ontzorgen? Kan je rekening houden met het adaptief vermogen van de samenleving en toch de klimaatdoelen halen? En wat betekent dat voor de plannen en  partijen die nu met de energietransitie bezig zijn?  Om antwoord 
te krijgen op deze vragen kwam  Medy van der Laan , voorzitter van Energie -Nederland , bij 
Stratelligence  terecht , een adviesbureau o.a. gespecialiseerd in het structureren en oplossen van 
complexe problemen  met een ‘adaptieve aanpak ’. Deze denkwijze mondde  eerder  uit in de 
methode adaptief deltamanagement voor het D eltaprogramma en de versterkte aandacht voor 
flexibiliteit en adaptiviteit in beleidsbeslissingen van de Nederlandse overheid.  
Wat betekent een adaptieve aanpak? Dat betekent dat je rekening houdt met het feit dat de overheid, de maatschappij of wie dan ook, het handelen na verloop van tijd kan bijstellen, bijvoorbeeld als de kosten van een alternatief  flink veranderen of als sommige risico’s achterhaald 
zijn of juist werkelijkheid worden. Je betrekt de factor tijd en flexibiliteit in de analyse.   
Met deze blik hebben we de analyse opgepakt en het rapport Een Laagdrempelige Energietransitie 
opgesteld. Het resultaat is een tweefasenstrategie gebaseerd op de resultaten van  vele studies van 
derden die we hebben  gecombineerd  en aangevuld . Op sommige punten verschillen de studies 
van inzicht, bijvoorbeeld over de beschikbare hoeveelheid hernieuwbaar gas of ov er de 
kosteneffectiviteit van warmtenetten. Met deze aanpak  willen we laten zien dat er een manier van 
kijken is die rekening houdt met deze verschillen van inzicht, met risico’s en onzekerheden, daar 
juist op inspeelt en die tot andere betere oplossingen kan leiden. Niemand kan het verloop van de transitie volledig voorspellen, maar we kunnen wel de stappen vooraf doordenken zodat keuzes minder risicovol worden en beter gebruik gemaakt wordt van kansen die zich de komende 30 jaar zullen voordoen. Een trans itie met meer effect tegen minder kosten is dan mogelijk. Deze visie is 
een hulpmiddel hierbij.

 Energie -Nederland ben ik dankbaar voor de opdracht en de kans deze manier van denken toe te 
passen op een zo relevant onderwerp, en de begeleidingscommissie bestaande uit Medy van der 
Laan, Walter Ruijgrok en Wouter Verduyn voor het mede vormgeven en op de proef stellen van 
het resultaat. Op deze plaats wil ik ook Rein Dijk en Jaco Reijerkerk bedanken. Zij hebben mij van waardevolle informatie en commentaar vo orzien en geholpen om de inzichten scherper te 
formuleren.  
Dit voorjaar start Energie -Nederland met activiteiten om deze visie om te zetten in actie: een 
energietransitie met minder drempels. Ik wens alle betrokkenen veel wijsheid en inspiratie toe bij het vormgeven van deze transitie.

 SAMEN VATTING  
De Nederlandse regering heeft klimaatdoelen gesteld. Om de ze klimaatdoelen te bereiken , is een 
efficiënte  uitrol van de energietransitie nodig. Dit kan niet zonder een breed  maatschappelijk 
draagvlak , vooral bij het verduurzamen van  de warmtevraag in de gebouwde omgeving . De 
huidige klimaatplannen vragen echter veel van de samenleving . Zijn de burgers bereid de 
benodigde aanpassingen aan hun woning uit te voeren en de bijbehorende kosten te dragen of 
krijgen we te maken met veel weerstand? In dat geval is het de vraag of we de klimaatdoelen wel 
zullen realiseren . 
Het doel van deze studie is om te verkennen of een ‘ laagdrempelige ’ energietransitie mogelijk is . 
Dat wil zeggen een transitie die rekening houdt met het adaptief vermogen van de samenleving, 
en die een betaalbare, schone en betrouwbare energievoorziening oplevert. Onderzocht  wordt of 
het mogelijk is o m de energietransitie als het ware vanzelf  te laten gaan. Bijvoorbeeld door het 
toepassen van een adaptieve aanpak, die rekening houdt met het feit dat keuzes gefaseerd kunnen worden of bijgesteld als de kosten van een alternatief flink veranderen of als sommige risico’s 
achterhaald zijn of juist werkelijkheid wo rden. Kan het betrekken van de factor tijd en flexibiliteit 
zoals in een adaptieve aanpak helpen de transitiedrempels te verlagen? Is er een strategie te  
bedenken die winst geeft voor iedereen én die de klimaatdoelen realiseert?  
Principes voor een laagdrem pelige  transitie  
Mensen meekrijgen bij een grote verandering zoals de energietransitie is lastig, zeker wanneer het 
een verandering betreft die z e niet zelf hebben gekozen. Je kan het proces weliswaar zo inrichten 
dat de medewerking toeneemt , bijvoorbeeld door mensen te helpen de hobbels  te nemen , maar 
ideaal  is een  plan, dat weinig of geen drempels opwerpt . Kosteneffectiviteit en k euzevrijheid voor 
de burger zijn  in een dergelijk plan essentiële  principes . Voor de gebouwde omgeving betekent 
dat de volgende uitgangs punten:  
1. Voor iedereen  een passende oplossing die betaalbaar, duurzaam en betrouwbaar is , en: 
a) Een overgang naar een (collectieve) alternatieve oplossing alleen wanneer 
voldoende zeker is dat dit de meest aantrekkelijke oplossing is.  
b) Ruimte voor individueel en lokaal initiatief.  
2. Focus op rendabele en autonome isolatiestappen van bestaande woningen.  
3. Vrijheid  bij het bepalen (en mogelijk faseren) van het individuele overstapmoment naar 
een duurzame energievoorziening . 
Kansrijke verduurzami ngsopties 
Er zijn in principe 5 v erduurzamings opties  voor de levering  van warmte : 1) een elektrische 
warmtepomp, 2) een LT(lagetemperatuur) -warmtenet, 3) een HT(hogetemperatuur) -warmtenet, 4) 
een hr -ketel gestookt met hernieuwbaar gas (groen gas en waterst of) en 5) een combinatie van 
optie 1 en 4, een hybride warmtepomp/cv -ketel.  Stratelligence  Een Laagdrempelige Energietransitie 
viii 
 Voor de meeste bewoners van bestaande woningen passen optie 3 (als het verduurzaming van een 
bestaand HT -warmtenet betreft), 4 en 5 het beste bij het idee van lage transitiedrempels . De reden 
is dat deze alternatieven geen verplichting tot isolatie van of grote aanpassingen in huis vragen  en 
de kosten en risico’s relatief beperkt zijn . Voor optie 4 en 5 is de overstap individueel te plannen 
en verduurzaming van een b estaand HT -warmtenet vraagt geen actie van  bewoners. Hierdoor 
worden drempels zoveel mogelijk voorkomen. Burgers zijn bovendien bekend met bestaande 
warmtenetten in hun huis en met gasgestookte ketels en boilers. Voor de nieuwbouw , die immers 
goed geïsoleerd is,  liggen elektrische oplossingen voor de hand . Collectieve warmte oplossingen1 
zijn ideaal v oor stedelijke of andere relat ief dichtbebouwde gebieden  die nu al dergelijke 
oplossingen  hebben. Het is nodig de  warmtebron te verduurza men en de 
langeter mijnbeschikbaarheid zeker te stellen . Bewoners merken hier weinig van  zolang  de 
watertemperatuur gelijk blijft. Voor specifieke segmenten zoals wijken met veel corporatiewoningen 
die nu nog geen stadswarmte hebben  en waar wel een goede warmtebron beschikbaar is , kan 
een overstap naar een warmtenet gunstig  zijn. 
Probleem met deze laagdrempelige strategie waarbij het merendeel van de bestaande woningen 
(voorlopig) nog gas blijft gebruiken  (optie 4 en 5) , is het beperkte aanbod van hernieuwbaar gas. 
Er is simpelweg niet voldoende hernieuwbaar gas voor iedereen.  Hoe kunnen we dan gedwongen 
keuzes voorkomen en toch de klimaatdoelen halen?  
Fasering laagdrempelige  energietransitie  
Isolatie van de woningvoorraad kan de vraag naar hernieuwbaar gas flink redu ceren. Om te 
passen in een laagdrempelige  energietransitie moet ook isolatie een vrije keuze zijn. 
Kosteneffectiviteit is dan cruciaal. Isolatie tot aan energielabel C verdient zich over het algemeen terug voor bestaande woningen. I solatie tot een hoger la bel is op dit moment meestal nog niet 
rendabel , maar dit kan veranderen . Isolatie alleen is nu niet toereikend  om de gasvraag voldoende 
te reduceren.  
Is een laagdrempelige energietransitie wel mogelijk? Wij denken van wel. Het isolatierendement 
en het aanbod van hernieuwbaar gas kunnen namelijk veranderen. En er is nog tijd. Fasering kan 
dan verstandig zijn, mits er voldoende voortgang is om de vastgelegde klimaatdoelen te halen.  
Hoe ziet deze fasering eruit? Tot 2050 zal het ge middelde huishouden nog twee keer een 
vervangingsmoment van de verwarmingsinstallatie meemaken. Hierdoor kan de energietransitie per huishouden in twee stappen worden uitgevoerd (zie Figuur 1). In de eerste fase richten we het 
beleid en de wijkaanpak op oplossingen die al op korte termijn aantrekkelijk zijn, niet hoeven te worden afgedwongen, beperkt risico van suboptimale keuzes kennen en weinig beroep d oen op 
het adaptief vermogen: de zogenaamde no -regret -keuzes. Een belangrijke no -regret -keuze is de 
overstap naar een hybride oplossing door huishoudens die veel gas gebruiken omdat dit een grote reductie in het aardgasgebruik oplevert. Daarnaast zorgen we  ervoor dat in fase 2 meer te kiezen 
valt. 
Bij het tweede vervangingsmoment is het goed mogelijk dat er inmiddels voldoende hernieuwbaar gas is om de resterende gasvraag in te vullen. Ook als dat niet zo is, dan zullen door toegenomen

warmte -koudeopslag (WKO) voor één appartementengebouw tot grote stadswarmtenetten die tienduizenden 
huishoudens van warmte voorzien.  Een Laagdrempelige Energietransitie Stratelligence

 kennis en technische ontwikkeling de onzekerheden, kosten en risico’s van bestaande opties kleiner 
zijn. Er zijn waarschijnlijk nieuwe alternatieven bijgekomen en isolatiemaatregelen zijn goedkoper 
geworden. Kortom de transitiedrempels liggen op dat moment lager dan nu.

Effect laagdrempelige  energietransitie  
De tweefasenstrategie is alleen acceptabel  als het afgesproken tussendoel uit het Klimaatakkoord 
in 2030 kan worden bereikt. Dit betekent dat we minimaal 3,4 Mton CO 2-uitstoot moeten besparen  
bovenop de besparing door de ver vangende CO 2-neutrale nieuwbouw. We verwachten dat d eze 
besparing te realiseren is met een combinatie van drie elementen :  
1. Warmtenetten dragen een deel van de reductie bij. De berekeningen voor dit rapport 
baseren we op de aannames dat in 2030 50% CO 2-reductie kan worden gerealiseerd  bij 
de bestaande warmtenetten door  verduurzam ing van de warmtebron en dat 200.000 
huurwoningen dan op een nieuw duurzaam warmtenet zijn  aangesloten . Dit aantal volgt 
het streefbeeld uit de PBL -berekeninge n van het ontwerpklimaatakkoord (PBL, april 2019) . 
In een laagdrempelige  energietransitie past een overstap naar een warmtenet v oor veel 
bestaande , minder goed geïsoleerde koopwoningen minder  goed. De CO 2-reductie van 
Stratelligence  Een Laagdrempelige Energietransitie 
x 
 koopwoningen die volgens het streefbeeld overgaan op  een warmtenet gebruiken  we 
daarom niet in de berekeningen . Dit betekent dat met nieuwe warmtenetten – in lijn met de 
doelstellingen uit het Klimaatakkoord –  nog een extra potentieel voor CO 2-reductie mog elijk 
is, bovenop onze berekeningen met de 200.000 huurwoningen.  
2. Vrijwillige rendabele isolatie levert ook een  bijdrage. We nemen in onze berekeningen 
aan dat één op de drie woningen met een laag energielabel voor 2030 overgaa t naar 
label C.  Isolatie tot l abel C is nu al rendabel.  
3. De derde bijdrage wordt geleverd  door toepassing van een hybride oplossing in een deel 
van de  resterende woningvoorraad.  
In de tweefasenstrategie zou m inimaal 24% van de nu gasgestookte koopwoningen moeten 
overgaan op een hybride  oplossing om in 2030 het tussendoel te halen. We verwachten dat dit 
haalbaar is . Het is zelfs mogelijk meer op de CO 2-uitstoot te besparen:  
• Gemiddeld t wee op de drie woningen krijgen de komende 10 jaar met een 
vervangingsvraag te maken. Dit betekent dat ongeveer éé n op de drie koop woningen dan 
voor een hybride warmtepomp moet kiezen. Dit  is een bescheiden  percentage in 
vergelijking met het omslagpunt waa rop een hybride oplossing voor de eigenaar 
kosteneffectief is. Vanaf  een gasverbruik van tussen de 500 en 1000 m3 compenseert de 
besparing op de energiekosten de hogere investering  van een hybride oplossing , ook 
zonder subsidie. Het gemiddelde gasverbruik per huishouden ligt tussen de 12 50 en 1300 
m3 en voor koopwoningen tussen de 1450 en 1500 m3. Een hoger vrijwillig 
overstappercentage is dus aannemelijk. Stel dat 75% van alle woningen  overgaat op een 
hybride oplossing , dan levert dat een besparing van 6, 8 Mton in 2030 op .  
• De CO 2-reductie kan nog hoger uitvallen.  Huishoudens die kiezen voor een hybride 
oplossing hebben waarschijnlijk een hoger gasgebruik dan gemiddeld. Dit vergroot de 
CO 2-reductie . En indien een deel van het gas bestaat uit hernieuwbaar gas, dan neemt  de 
besparing verder toe.  
De kosten van deze strategie liggen lager dan in het klimaatakkoord doordat keuzes voor 
maatregelen met een grote onrendabele top worden vervangen door kosteneffectieve maatregelen.  
 
Figuur 2:  indicatief verloop CO 2-reductie laagdrempelige energietransitie; na 2030 wordt aardgas geleidelijk 
vervangen door hernieuwbaar gas  
Een Laagdrempelige Energietransitie Stratelligence  
xi 
 Voor fase 2 is er veel minder gas nodig dan op dit moment (zie Figuur 2). De restvraag (het 
equivalent van 3,1 tot 5,7 miljard m3 aardgas) kan volgens diverse prognoses in 2050 
kosteneffectief ingevuld worden met hernieuwbaar gas, mits de overheid het juiste beleid voert.  
Deze strategie betekent keuzevrijheid, beperkte overlast, minder verschillen en ongelijkheid qua 
energievoorziening en relatief lage kosten. De kans dat de klimaatdoelen daadwerkelijk bereikt worden en het aardgasgebruik snel afneem t, is groter .  
Nationaal beleid  
In de tweefasenstrategie maakt men  in fase 1 no -regret -keuzes en i n fase 2 voor alle woningen een 
definitieve keuze.  
Om de keuzemogelijkheden na 2030 te vergroten, is het aan te bevelen in fase 1 pilots uit te (blijven) voeren met nieuwe veelbelovende technieken en de kosten van deze pilots te socialiseren, 
zodat na 2030 meer bewezen technieken tegen een lagere prijs beschikbaar zijn.  
Uitgaande van een  laagdrempelige transitie  is in fase 2 meer hernieuwbaar gas gewenst . Het is 
daarom van belang dat de overheid in fase 1 de nationale opschaling van de groengas - en 
waterstofproductie gaat  voorbereiden. Ook snelle (re) uitbreiding van het aanbod groene stroom is 
essentieel .  
De levering van hernieuwbaar gas heeft een organisatie  nodig vergelijkbaar met de organisatie  
van de uitrol van aardgas destijds . Nu zijn provincies, gemeenten en industriële clusters de trekkers, 
maar er is nog niet gezorgd voor een organisatie die alles bij elkaar brengt en er een landelijk 
dekkend systeem van maakt .  
In de voorgestelde tweefasenstrategie is a fsluiting van het aardgasnet de komende jaren geen 
uitgangspunt, met dien verstande dat nieuwbouw sinds 2018 niet meer op het aardgas net wordt 
aange sloten.  
Wijkaanpak  
Geadviseerd wordt de wijkaanpak op te delen in twee fasen en onderscheid te maken in diverse 
typen wijken. In fase 1 wordt de wijkaanpak onderverdeeld in:  
• Nieuwbouwwijken . Hier wordt in principe voor elektrische verwarming gekozen of 
aansluiting op een LT -warmtenet. Een warmtepomp past beter bij grondgebonden 
koopwoningen en een LT -warmtenet beter bij meergezins-  en huurwoningen.  
• Wijken met een warmtenet. Voor bestaande H T-warmtenetten moet gezocht worden naar 
betaalbare, betrouwbare en duurzame bronnen, zodat het energiegebruik van de 
aangesloten woningen automatisch vergroent . Uitbreiding van bestaande netten is een 
optie als er zekerheid is over de langetermijnbeschikba arheid van warmtebronnen, d it 
alternatief als  collectieve oplossing brede steun geniet en kosteneffectiever  is dan de 
alternatieven.  
• Homogene wijken. Voor qua isolatieniveau en type woning homogene wijken waar een 
groot deel in eigendom van corporaties is of utiliteit betreft en sprake is van een hoge bebouwingsdichtheid, kan een collectieve warmte oplossing  de meest aantrekkelijke optie 
zijn. Belangrijk is ook hier dat een HT - of LT-warmtenet (en dus een systeemverandering) 
alleen wordt gekozen als er zeker heid is over de langetermijnbeschikbaarheid  van Stratelligence  Een Laagdrempelige Energietransitie 
xii 
 warmtebronnen, d it alternatief als  collectieve oplossing  brede steun geniet en 
kosteneffectiever  is dan de alternatieven.  
• Heterogene wijken. In qua eigendom en isolatieniveau heterogene wijken ondersteunt de  
wijkaanpak een vrijwillige overstap naar warmtepomp of hybride oplossing en isolatie. In 
deze wijken kiest men in fase 1 niet per wijk  de beste oplossing, maar wordt gestimuleerd 
dat eigenaren individueel  de beste optie kiezen bij het volgende vervangingsmoment van 
de installatie en dat ze isolatiemaatregelen en efficiëntiemaatregelen uitvoeren die zichzelf terugverdienen . Voor woonkostenneutraliteit zijn dan geen grote subsidiebedragen nodig. 
De meerwaarde van de wijkaanpak om gezamenlijk de beste oplossi ng te kiezen , is voor 
deze wijken kleiner, doordat de vervangingsmomenten van installaties en de verschillen tussen de woningen groot zijn. In deze wijken blijft het gasnet in ieder geval in fase 1 beschikbaar.  
In fase 2 zijn mogelijk aanvullende stappen n odig om het elektriciteitsnet te verzwaren en de uitrol 
van hernieuwbaar gas  te faciliteren. Ook kunnen warmtenetten voor meer huishoudens interessant 
worden.  
Door deze adaptieve en gefaseerde aanpak mag op minder weerstand in de samenleving worden 
gerekend als gevolg van meer autonomie en keuzevrijheid, lagere kosten en minder overlast en minder gedwongen ingrepen in de woning. Burgers en wijken krijgen de mogelijkheid op het 
basisalternatief v ooruit te lopen. Anderen hoeven weinig te doen, maar kunnen kiezen voor opties 
die goed zijn voor hun portemonnee. Voor iedereen is er een goede en betaalbare oplossing beschikbaar. De noodzakelijke CO
2-reductie vraagt een kleinere investering en het 
aardg asverbruik neemt sneller af. De haalbaarheid van het bereiken van de klimaatdoelen neemt 
zo fors toe.  En dat is winst voor iedereen.

 HOOFDSTUK 1    DE KLIMAATPLANNEN : EEN GRO TE OPGAVE 
VOOR DE SAMENLEVING  
De Nederlandse regering heeft klimaatdoelen gesteld . Voor het realiseren  van deze doelen  is een 
afname  van de uitstoot nodig in alle sectoren: de gebouwde omgeving, mobiliteit, de industrie, 
landbouw en landgebruik, en de elektriciteit(sopwekking) , zie Figuur 3.  
 
Figuur 3:  ontwikkeling uitstoot CO2 -equivalenten2 sinds 1990 en reductiedoelen  
De energietransitie in de gebouwde omgeving  
Voor de gebouwde omgeving is het streven o m de CO 2-uitstoot nagenoeg tot nul te beperken . 
Daartoe moeten a lle Nederlandse woningen in  2050 aardgasvrij zijn . Het gaat om bijna 8  miljoen 
woning en die vaak beperkt  geïsoleerd  zijn en vrijwel allemaal verwarmd worden met  aardgas. Het 
klimaatakkoord noemt daarnaast een  tweede reden  om af te stappen van aardgas . We willen zo 
snel mogelijk kunnen stoppen met de aardgaswinning  in Groningen.  
In de gebouwde omgeving geschiedt  de uitvoering van de transitie via een wijkgerichte aanpak. 
Dat wil zeggen dat per wijk de warmteoplossing en en verbouwingen  worden  georganiseerd  in een 
nauwe samenwerking tussen gemeenten , bewoners en eigenaren  van gebouwen . 
Uiterlijk eind 2021 zullen g emeenten een transitievisie warmte presenteren  met het tijdspad voor 
een stapsgewijze aanpak richting aardgasvrij e wijken . Voor wijken die voor 2030 aan de beurt 
komen , zijn dan  de potentiële  alternatieve energiebronnen bekend. Gemeenten  moeten inzicht 
bieden in de maatschappelijke  kosten  en baten en de integrale kosten van de alternatieven voor 
eindgebruikers. Het is de bedoeling dat gemeenten zoveel als mogelijk kiezen voor alternatieven 
 
2 In feite gaat het om de reductie van broeikasgassen: kool stofdioxide (CO 2), methaan, distikstofoxide, 
fluorhoudende stoffen en ozon. Het grootste deel zal moeten worden gerealiseerd door CO 2-reductie.  
In de Klimaatwet stelt Nederland 
dat de CO 2-uitstoot in 2030 met 
49% en in 2050 met 95% ten 
opzichte van 1990 moet zijn 
verminderd. Het Klimaatakkoord bevat een pakket aan voorstellen 
dat het politieke re ductiedoel voor 
2030 moet rea liseren. Daarnaast 
heeft het ge rechtshof in Den Haag 
op 9 ok tober 2018 geoordeeld in 
een procedure va n Urgenda tegen 
de Neder landse Staat dat eind 
2020 ten minste 25% minder 
broeikasgas moet worden uit gesto-
ten. De Hoge Raad heeft dit vonnis 
bekrachtigd.  Stratelligence  Een Laagdrempelige Energietransitie

tenneutraliteit is een  uitgangspunt.  
Een grote  maatschappelijke  opgave  
De transitie  gaat niet vanzelf  en vraagt veel investeringen. Voor het slagen ervan is een zo efficiënt 
mogelijke uitrol essentieel. Veel bewoners van bestaande bouw zullen ingrijpende isolatiemaatre -
gelen en aanpassingen in huis  moeten (laten) uitvoeren om over te kunnen stappen op een duur -
zaam alternatief.  Naast initiatieven  die enthousiast  ontvangen zijn, zijn er  ook ‘tegenvallers’ , zoals 
de rechtszaak  tegen de gemeente Amsterdam over het warmtenet, het afzien van een dure gasvrije 
renovatie door een Groningse woningcorporatie en d e problemen  met het Rotterdams warmtenet.4 
Er zijn weinig a lternatieven die bij alle betrokkenen op steun kunnen rekenen. De aanleg is daarom 
kwetsbaar  voor vertraging door ingewikkelde participatieprocessen of (bezwaar) procedures.   
Een ‘laagdrempelige ’ energietransitie ? 
Het proces naar aardgasvrij brengt een hoop onzekerheden met zich mee. Het maken van de juiste 
keuzes vraagt goed inzicht in en technische kennis van de mogelijkheden . Voor veel alternatieven 
zijn de effecten nog niet volledig te overzien. Vaak blijken de kosten op de korte termijn  doorslag -
gevend te zijn om een bepaalde keuze voor maatregelen of technologieën te maken. Voor verschil -
lende warmteopties nemen de technische risico’s en kosten echter op wat langere termijn  af. Het 
vroegtijdig maken van een keuze die achteraf niet de meest duurzame,  betrouwbare  en kostenef -
fectieve blijkt te zijn, kan de kosten van de en ergietransitie verder doen oplopen en het draagvlak 
verminderen . Het risico op ver traging in de verdere uitrol neemt in dit geval toe.  
Te veel  uitstellen is echter geen optie. De resterende tijd kan onvoldoende zijn om de woning voor-
raad aardgasvrij te maken. Er  is immers voor 2030 een tussendoel afgesproken . Het algemene 
reductie doel van 49% voor 2030 is  voor de gebouwde omgeving door PBL vertaald in  3,4 Mton 
minder CO 2-uitstoot ten opzichte van het referentiepad .5 Daartoe moeten we ongeveer 1,5 miljoen 
bestaande woningen voor 2030 aardgasvrij  maken en de uitstoot van de utiliteitsbouw met 1 Mton 
terugbrengen  (Klimaatakkoord, juni 2019) . Stel dat de energietransitie mogelijk is op een wijze 
die de kans op maatschappelijk sub optimale keuzes verkleint , en die als het ware vanzelf gaat , 
dan kan daarmee de slaagkans van het bereiken van de  klimaatdoel en sterk toenemen . 
In deze studie verkennen  we of een energietransitie  mogelijk is  die rekening houdt met het adaptief 
vermogen  van de samenleving  en die een betaalbare, schone en betrouwbare  energievoorziening 
oplevert . Met het adaptief vermogen bedoelen we de bereidheid van de samenleving om het 
gedrag aan te passen en veranderingen te absorberen. Bestudeerd wordt of het mogelijk is om de 
energietransitie als het ware vanzelf  te laten gaan.  Kan het betrekken van de factor tijd e n 
flexibiliteit zoals in een adaptieve aanpak helpen de transitiedrempels te verlagen? Is er een 
strategie te  bedenken die winst geeft voor iedereen én die de klimaatdoelen realiseert?  
 
3 Voor de maatschappelijke kostenberekeningen wordt uitgegaan van ‘ nationale’  kosten zonder belastingen, 
heffingen en subsidies. Dit is omdat de hoogten van de belastingen, hef fingen en subsidies beleidskeuzen zijn 
die kunnen helpen de kosten te herverdelen, maar niet de basiskosten aanpakken. Voor de kosten van 
eindgebruikers zijn ze wel van belang.

 HOOFDSTUK 2    PRINCIPES  OM DE SAMENLEVING  TE ONTZIEN  
De huidige klimaatplannen leveren onvoldoende CO 2-reductie op om de doelen voor 2020 en 
2030 te realiseren  (zie Tabel 1). In de gebouwde omgeving komt d e energietransitie moeizaam 
op gang . PBL komt uit op 0,25 tot 1,1 miljoen aardgasvrije gebouwen in 2030 in plaats van de 
beoogde 1,5 miljoen (PBL, mei 2019) . Ook nieuwsb erichten over de energietransitie gaan steeds 
vaker over tegenvallers. Deze ontwikkelingen  lijken deels verklaard te kunnen worden vanuit het 
adaptief vermogen van de samenleving.

In dit hoofdstuk gaan we in op factoren die de transitiebereidheid  beïnvloeden . Eerst vatten  we 
beelden en gevoelens samen die nu leven in de samenleving en die zijn geïnventariseerd  in 
verschillende onderzoeken. Vervolgens kijken we naar algemene oorzaken  die weerstand kunnen 
verklaren en naar de vorige energietransitie in Nederland, de overstap naar aardgas, en wat we 
daarvan  kunnen leren. Het hoofdstuk sluit  af met principes die kunnen helpen om deze 
energietransitie meer als vanzelf te laten gaan doordat het adaptief vermogen minder hoeft te 
worden aangesproken . 
2.1 HET ADAPTIEF VERMOGEN EN DE ENERGIETRANSITIE  
Burgers staan in meerderheid positief tegen over de energietransitie en het tegengaan van 
klimaatverandering  (Steenbekkers, et al., 2019) . Ze tonen echter weinig initiatief om met de woning 
aan de slag te gaan. Belangrijke redenen hiervoor zijn verwachtingen over voortschrijdende techniek, zorgen over betaalbaarheid en eff ectiviteit van maatregelen en onzekerheid over beleid  
(Steenbekkers, et al., 2019) . Ook spelen  de impact van de benodigde ingrepen achter de voordeur 
en het verlies aan controle een  rol. 
Weerstand tegen verplichte isolatie en aa npassing  
Hoewel er een actieve opstelling van woningeigenaren verwacht wordt in de wijkaanpak voelt men zich (te) weinig betrokken bij de transitie (Steenbekkers, et al., 2019) . Het aardgasvrijmaken voelt 
als iets wat burgers opgelegd krijgen en druist daarmee in tegen de behoefte aan autonomie. Het Stratelligence  Een Laagdrempelige Energietransitie 
4 
 veroorzaakt een gevoel van verlies aan controle. Betrokkenen zijn niet altijd bekend met plannen 
van de gemeente en als ze er wel van op de hoogte zijn, zijn ze het niet altijd eens met de keuzes. 
Dit leidt soms tot stopzetting van verduurzamingsprojecten, zoals in Amsterdam waar woningcorporatie Eigen Haard van de rechter moest stoppen met het aardgasvrijmaken van een wijk omdat niet kon worden gegarandeerd dat de bewoners niet voor  de kosten van verduurzaming 
op zouden draaien.  
Van het gas afgaan vraagt om intensieve ingrepen in huis, waar men lang niet altijd op staat te 
wachten als er verder geen goede reden is om te verbouwen. Verduurzamen doen Nederlanders het liefst als er toc h al een verbouwing of onderhoud plaatsvindt (ABN -AMRO, oktober 2019) . 
Bijna 31% van de Nederlanders geeft aan deze momenten het meest ideaal te vinden. Onderzoek uitgevoerd in het Verenigd Koninkrijk bevestigt dit (Department of Energy & Climate Change, november 2011) . Momenten waarop men verduurzamingsmaatregelen eerder overweegt, zijn bij 
de aankoop van een nieuwe woning, vooral als het een langetermijninvestering of definitieve verhuizing betreft , bij een grote renovatie en bij de vervanging van een boiler of 
verwarmingssysteem. Dit ligt voor de hand: de woning is waarschijnlijk vrij van rommel of moet 
toch worden opgeruimd en de verstoring door de installatie van duurzame producten is minder 
belastend als er al een andere renovatie aan de gang is. Het is ook een tijd waarin vaak 
financiering wordt geregeld. Uitbreiding van de financiering om de woning te verduurzamen,  is 
dan weinig werk (Cabinet Office Behavioural Insights Team, July 2011) . 
Hoge kosten zijn drempel  
De financiële ruimte is eveneens een belangrijk thema. Van de koopwoningbezitters geeft 38% aan 
dat de kosten voor hen een drempel zijn (ABN -AMRO, oktober 2019) . Een aanleiding om  wel tot 
verduurzaming over te gaan is dan ook het beschikbaar komen van extra geld (zie Figuur 4). Een 
vergelijkbaar percentage is te vinden in onderzoek in het Verenigd Koninkrijk naar de redenen die 
mensen weerhouden meer te doen aan verduurzaming van het huis. Redenen zijn gebrek aan geld (35%), al voldoende gedaan (24%), te veel gedoe of overlast (15%) en gebrek aan tijd (15%).  
De kosten worden door de eigenwoningbezitters hoger ingeschat dan de kosten die volgens het EIB nodig zijn (EIB, mei 2018) . Het EIB geeft aan dat een investering van ongeveer € 22.000 
nodig is om een slecht geïsoleerde woning goed te isoleren . De eigenwoningbezitters schatten in 
dat dit gemiddeld € 33.000 kost  (ABN -AMRO, oktober 2019) .

 Twijfel over geclaimde kostenneutraliteit  
Veel mensen vragen zich af of kostenneutraliteit wel reëel  is. Zijn de baten wel hoger dan de kosten 
en wat levert isolatie de woningeigenaar op? Investeringen om van een beperkte of slechte isolatie 
naar een zeer goed geïsoleerde woning te gaan, vloerverwarming en LT(lagetemperatuur) -
radiatoren aan te leggen, lijken nu nog niet terug te verdienen zonder forse subsidies. Volgens verschillende bronnen (EI B, mei 2018)  (Tigchelaar, et al., 2019) , (ING economisch Bureau, oktober 
2019)  zijn veel isolatiemaatregelen en nieuwe technieken op dit moment nog niet kosteneffectief 
voor de gebruiker.  
Dit beeld is vergelijkbaar met de resultaten van onderzoek in Groot -Brittannië (Department of Energy 
& Climate Change, november 2011) . Respondenten geven aan dat ze gestimuleerd zouden 
worden hun huis te verduurzamen als het tot lag ere kosten zou leiden (46%), als er subsidie 
beschikbaar zou komen (32%), als ze overtuigende informatie hadden dat de maatregelen tot een warmer huis en lagere energierekening zouden leiden (24%) en als ze informatie zouden ontvangen van een betrouwbare bron over het verminderen van het energiegebruik (19%).  
Bovendien zijn kosten via heffingen en subsidie wel kunstmatig lager te maken, maar feitelijk nemen de kosten voor de energievoorziening toe. Zeker als bestaande investeringen eerder afgeschreven moeten worden vanwege de verplichte overstap naar een alternatieve energiebron. Denk daarbij aan voortijdige afschrijving van een bestaande installatie bij de overgang naar een collectieve oplossing of een eerdere renovatie die onvoldoende is door de overgang naar LT -verwarming. Ook 
participatietrajecten en communicatie met bewoners verhogen de kosten.  
Onzekerheid over technieken en toezeggingen  
Zorgen over betaalbaarheid lijken gerelateerd aan bezorgdheid over de effectiviteit van warmtebronne n en onzekerheid over toekomstige ontwikkelingen. Veel alternatieve technieken zijn 
nog niet uitontwikkeld. Naar verwachting zullen de prijzen voor deze technieken zakken. Dan betekent nu al investeren hogere kosten dan nodig en mogelijk last hebben van ki nderziekten. Het 
is aannemelijk dat tot 2050 nog nieuwe technieken op de markt komen. De meerderheid is daarom geneigd een afwachtende houding aan te nemen (Steenbekkers, et al., 2019) . 
Er is bovendien enig wantrouwen dat de hu idige plannen daadwerkelijk zullen worden doorgezet 
en beloftes en toezeggingen over kostencompensatie worden nagekomen (Steenbekkers, et al., 2019) . Burgers hebben daarbij een beperkt vertrouwen in (informatie van) de overheid  en 
marktpartijen. Men lijkt meer te vertrouwen op de kennis en ervaring van buurtgenoten dan op de kennis van een externe bron.  
Solidariteit met mogelijke verliezers  
De kosten van de transitie moeten eerlijk worden verdeeld, maar wat is eerlijk en rechtva ardig in 
dit verband? De energietransitie in de gebouwde omgeving zal winnaars en verliezers kennen (ECN, december 2017) . Huishoudens met een laag inkomen betalen naar verhouding een groter 
deel van hun inkomen aan energie en wonen vaak in minder goed geïsoleerde woningen. Net als 
in andere landen is in Nederland de energiequote - het percentage van het besteedbaar inkomen 
dat nodig is om de energierekening te betalen -  de afgelopen jaren gestegen en ondanks de belofte 
van het kabinet lijkt de hoogte van de energierekening door de verduurzaming eerder te stijgen dan te dalen. Woningen en energie -installaties van hoge en lage inkomens moeten de komende Stratelligence  Een Laagdrempelige Energietransitie 
6 
 jaren aangepast worden om de klimaatdoelen te halen en om de bewoners te besch ermen tegen 
te hoge energierekeningen door de stijgende belasting op aardgas. De investeringen zijn echter 
voor hoge inkomens eenvoudiger op te brengen dan voor de lage. En niet overal zal een even 
kosteneffectieve oplossing beschikbaar komen. Energiearmoede en energieongelijkheid worden daardoor een groeiend probleem.  
Verschillende groepen vragen een andere aanpak  
Niet iedereen ervaart de energietransitie op dezelfde wijze. Er zijn verschillen die samenhangen 
met het type woning, het eigendom en de regio. Niet overal zijn dezelfde verwarmingsalternatieven 
voorhanden. Als huurder valt er minder te kiezen en te doen dan als eigenaar. Ook spelen 
persoonlijke factoren een rol zoals leeftijd, opleidingsniveau, inkomen, voorkeuren en attitude. 
Zowel de mate van a utonomie als gezamenlijkheid zijn van belang. Iedereen wil graag controle 
houden over zijn eigen situatie, maar velen zien de meerwaarde van een collectieve aanpak waarbij kennis, kunde en kosten worden gedeeld.  
 
Figuur 5:  categ orieën ingedeeld naar tempo van adoptie nieuwe technieken (Rogers, 1961)  
De meeste mensen willen bovendien pas meedoen als de ontwikkelingen in de energietransitie wat verder zijn en de aanpassingen duidelijk voordeel bieden. D e vroege en late meerderheid zijn 
kostenbewust en houden niet van risico’s (zie Figuur 5). Sommigen willen vooroplopen en zijn 
bereid voor de goede zaak meerkosten voor lief te nemen. De innovators  en early adopters  hebben 
we nodig in de energietransitie om anderen te inspireren. Koplopers die op eigen initiatief de verduurzaming van de woning of de wijk willen aanpakken, hebben nu te maken met kaders die nog onvoldoende concreet zijn en incentives die te beperkt zijn om daadkrachtig aan de gang te gaan. Bovendien wonen deze mensen  niet allemaal in één wijk, waardoor een innovatieve 
collectieve oplossing moeilijk te realiseren is. Om de energietransitie een succes te maken, is het belangrijk met al deze verschillen rekening te houden.  
Onderzoek (Department of  Energy & Climate Change, november 2011)  onder inwoners van het 
Verenigd Koninkrijk liet zien dat de groepen die het meest geïnteresseerd waren in het greendeal -
aanbod jong waren, mannelijk, mensen die inkomensafhankelijke vergoedingen ontvingen, 
huishoudens die twee of meer energie- efficiëntiemaatregelen nodig hadden, mensen met moeilijk 
Een Laagdrempelige Energietransitie Stratelligence  
7 
 te verwarmen huizen, mensen die moeite hadden om hun rekeningen te betalen, degenen die op 
het platteland woonden en de welgestelden. Uit het onderzoek bleek ook dat huishoudens met 
mensen ouder dan 70 jaar of met een uitkering, minder geneigd waren om een 
verduurzamingsaanbod aan te nemen.  
Kader 1:  10 redenen voor weerstand en mogelijkheden om hiermee rekening te houden bi j de energietransitie  
(gebaseerd op Moss Kanter, september 2012)  
1. Verlies aan controle . Verandering verstoort het gevoel van autonomie. We doen vaak als eerste een beroep op 
ons gevoel van zelfbeschikking als we worden geconfronteerd met een ( potentiële) verandering. Het ruimte laten 
voor eigen keuzes en mee laten praten over de verandering geeft mensen eigenaarschap. De keuze voor een 
wijkgerichte aanpak sluit hierbij aan. Participatie vergroot de betrokkenheid bij de uitkomst en vermindert de 
weerstand.  Door de keuze voor de v ervanging van aard gas en voor isolatie meer aan de mensen zelf over te la -
ten, neemt  de weerstand  af. 
2. Te veel onzekerheid. Mensen blijven liever ongelukkig met wat ze kennen dan dat ze het onbekende tegemoet 
gaan. Om mensen in beweging te krijgen , moeten ze zich veilig voelen. Dit betekent dat de verandering gepaard 
moet gaan met een inspirerende visie en met duidelijkheid over de te nemen stappen, anders schiet men in de 
weerstand. Het is belangrijk dat de onzekerheid daadwerkelijk  kan worden wegg enomen en dat gekozen wordt 
voor opties met zo min mogelijk  risico.  
3. Verrassing. Als mensen opeens geconfronteerd worden met beslissingen, zonder tijd om aan het idee te wennen 
of zonder  tijd om noodzakelijke maatregelen te nemen op een moment dat het hen uitkomt, zorgt dat voor weer -
stand. Het is veel beter mensen voor te bereiden op aankomende veranderingen en voldoende tijd te geven om 
aan het idee te wennen. Geef hen ruimte om benodigde aanpassingen voor de afstap van aardgas in te plannen.  
4. Alles lijkt anders. Verandering zorgt voor wijzigingen.  Te veel wijzi gingen tegelijk maakt mensen oncomfortabel. 
Beperk daarom het aantal wijzigingen dat  het gevolg is van een grote  verandering  zoals de energietransitie. 
Probeer een oplossing te vinden die het aantal wijzigingen tot het minimum beperkt.  
5. Gezichtsverlies . Reeds gedane voorstellen  voor de energietransitie zijn misschien niet optimaal. Het lijkt verstan -
dig te onderzoeken of er oplossingen zijn die meer rekening houden met het adaptief vermogen van de samen -
leving.  
6. Zorgen over competenties . Kan ik dat wel? Maken we wel de goede ke uzes? Mensen vragen zich af of zij zelf en 
de andere betrokken  partijen wel de juiste kennis en vaardigheden bezitten. In deze situatie moet gezorgd 
worden voor  het verstrekken  van hulpmidde len en informatie en in het laten bepalen van de beste aanpak door  
partijen met kennis van zaken.  
7. Meer werk. Verandering gaat gepaard met meer werk. Voor een veranderingstraject moet extra capaciteit komen  
en is het erkennen en belonen van prestaties van belang.  Geef markt en burger voldoende tijd en capaciteit om 
keuzes te maken en aanpassin gen uit te voeren  en laat ze profiteren van maatschappelijk aantrekkelijke keuzes . 
8. Rimpeleffecten . Verandering zorgt voor beweging, overlast en gedoe. Deze ‘rimpelingen’ hebben gevolgen voor 
anderen die geen belang hebben  bij de verandering . Het is verstandig de overlast voor dergelijke partijen zoveel 
mogelijk te beperken . 
9. Negatieve gevoelens uit het verleden . Op het moment dat er iets verandert , gaan gevoelens en ervaring en uit het 
verleden meespelen. Gebrek aan vertrouwen of wantrouwen moet eerst worden geadresseerd voordat aan 
nieuwe uitdagingen kan worden  begonnen.  Houd daarom rekening met bestaande gevoelens in de maatschappij 
over de betrouwbaarheid van de overheid en  met (negatieve) ervaringen met warmtenetten en a ardbevingsri -
sico’s.  
10. Soms is het echt een bedreiging. Er is weerstand tegen verandering omdat het pijn doet. Door de energietransitie 
kunnen waardevolle elementen van de  woning en eerdere investeringen verl oren gaan en kan de energierekening 
hoger uitvallen. Als veranderingen een achteruitgang betekenen en de verandering echt noodzakelijk is, is het 
devies  eerlijk, snel en redelijk zijn , maar het beste is om te voorkomen dat de energietransitie een bedreigin g 
wordt door een betrouw bare, betaalbare en duurzame oplossing voor iedereen mogelijk te maken.

 2.2 HET ADAPTIEF VERMOGEN EN WEERSTAND TEGEN VERANDERING  
Weerstand tegen verandering is normaal en kan zich op vele manieren manifesteren: getreuzel, 
afwachten of actieve tegenwerking. In principe willen mensen meestal alles bij het oude laten. We vinden het moeilijk om een verandering te accepteren, zeker wanneer het een verandering betreft 
die we niet wensen en niet zelf hebben gekozen. Mensen meekrijgen bij een verandering is dan 
ook lastig. De energietransitie is wat dit betreft niet anders dan een organisatieverandering. In deze paragraaf kijken we wat we daarvan en van de vorige energietransitie kunnen leren.  
Het overkomen van weerstand tegen veranderingen  
Verschillende factoren verklaren weerstand tegen verandering. Anticiperen op deze factoren kan 
dan helpen om de haalbaarheid van de energietransitie te vergroten. Factoren die weerstand 
verklaren en mogelijkheden om hiermee rekening te houden, zijn op veel verschillende manieren te ordenen. Wij gebruiken de indeling van Moss Kanter (Moss Kanter, september 2012) , zie Kader 
1, vorige pagina . Factoren die nu terugkomen in de gebouwde omgeving zijn, ingedeeld  in dit 
schema:  
• Punt 1: ‘verlies aan controle ’. Dit komt terug in de weerstand tegen verplichte isolatie en 
aanpa ssing van de woning; en  
• Punt 10: ‘soms is het echt een bedreiging ’. Doordat er geen passend alternatief is of de 
nadelen groter zijn dan de voordelen (hoge kosten, mogelijke verliezers).  
Ook onzekerheid (punt 2), z orgen over competenties (punt 6) en negatieve gevoelens (punt 9) 
spelen een rol.  
Hoe kunnen we hier rekening mee houden ? Niet altijd is het mogelijk om alle pijn van een 
verandering weg  te nemen. De klimaatdoelen staan vast.  
Vaak ziet men dat wordt ingespeeld  op factoren die helpen de boodschap te ‘verkopen ’. Het proces  
wordt zo ingericht dat het gemakkelijker is een transitiedrempel te nemen , bijvoorbeeld door 
participatie of een deel van de opbrengsten te laten terugvloeien naar de omgeving  (zie Tabel 2). 
Deze aanpak  zien we terug in wetenschappelijke literatuur  (Devine-Wright, 2011) , (Ciupuliga, et 
al., 2013) , in de gekozen wijkaanpak met de nadruk op participatie en in adviezen die op dit 
gebied verschijnen (Tigchelaar, et al., 2019)  (ECN, oktober 2017) . 
Een alternatieve aanpak is het beperken  van transitiedrempels. Deze mogelijkhe id krijgt in de 
aanpak van de energietransitie en  in de literatuur minder  aandacht. In het Verenigd Koninkrijk is 
er wel een aansprekend voorbeeld  te vinden . Daar lijkt het beleid voor de gebouwde omgeving 
wel wat op dat van Nederland, maar zijn ze tien jaar geleden begonnen  (Cabinet Office 
Behavioural Insights Tea m, July 2011) . Het gaat om  een proef met het in combinatie aanbieden 
van het opruimen van de zolder en dakisolatie om het isolatiepercentage van zolders te vergroten. Uit eerder onderzoek was nl. naar voren gekomen dat het ‘gedoe’ mensen  ervan weerhield de 
zolder te isoleren  (Department of Energy & Climate Change, november 2011) . De resultaten  van 
de proef l aten zien dat een hoger percentage overging tot isolatiemaa tregel en wanneer het ‘gedoe ’ 
uit handen werd ge nomen. De am bitie in de Nederlandse situatie om woningeigenaren en huurders 
maximaal te ontzorgen , sluit aan  bij deze Engelse ervaringen.   
Het op dergelijke wijze diagnosticeren van de bronnen van weerstand is een eerste stap op weg naar het vinden oplossingen.   Een Laagdrempelige Energietransitie Stratelligence

De revolutie van Slochteren: lessen uit verleden  
De huidige energietransitie is niet de eerste energietransitie die Nederland meemaakt. De overgang 
van het gebruik van steenkool, stadsgas en oliestook naar aardgas in de jaren 60 wordt beschouwd als een succesvolle transitie die Nederland in hoog tempo ni et alleen een landelijk dekkende 
energie- infrastructuur opleverde maar ook het welvaart-  en comfortniveau deed stijgen (Verbong, 
2000) . In enkele jaren werd een landelijke hoofdtransportleiding aangelegd en werden ongeveer 
5 miljoen kook - en verwarmingstoestellen vervangen of omgebouwd. Voor dat doel was een 
nationale organisatie ingesteld. De totale kosten van de operatie bedroegen ongeveer 650 miljoen gulden. Van de burgers werd geen bijdrage gevraagd. Zij werden volledig ontz orgd (zie verder 
Kader 2, volgende pagina).  
2.3 
PRINCIPES VOOR EEN LAAGDREMPELIGE ENERGIETRANSITIE  
De vorige energietransitie was er één die op grote medewerking kon rekenen  en die Nederland 
vooruithielp. Wat kunnen we hiervan leren? Belangrijke succesfactoren waren het feit dat de burger er qua comfort flink op vooruitging. Het milieu werd minder belast. Ervaringsdeskundigen bereidden de implementatie goed voor en voerden deze snel en efficiënt uit. De burger werd daarbij volledig ontzorgd en hoefde niet zelf te investeren.  
In de huidige transitie ontbreekt het nog aan deze succesfactoren. Op gebied van comfort is geen duidelijke verbetering zichtbaar. Qua hoogte van de energ ierekening gaat men - zo lijkt het nu - er 
eerder op achteruit dan op vooruit en van ontzorging is nu nog weinig sprake. De burger mag participeren, maar het voelt vaak als moeten meewerken aan het vinden van een goede wijkoplossing. Woningeigenaren moet hun huis isoleren en eventueel een extra hypotheek nemen 
als dat nodig is om alle kosten te dekken. Dit alles zonder dat men de zekerheid heeft de juiste keuze te maken en op termijn beter af te zijn. Komt er over een paar jaar niet een aantrekkelijker, goedk oper alternatief? Is het niet verstandiger te wachten? Wie betaalt de voortijdige afschrijving 
van de cv -ketel bij de overstap naar een collectieve oplossing? Ook wanneer de meerkosten gedekt 
worden uit subsidie en de gemeente of woningcorporatie de keuze maakt, twijfelt men aan de 
goede bedoelingen en kennis van zaken van deze partijen. Kan men straks nog wel kiezen uit 
verschillende energieaanbieders, of moet men verplicht meedoen aan een collectieve oplossing? Hoe zit het met de leverbetrouwbaarheid en p rijs op termijn?

 Kader 2:  de revolutie van Slochteren (Verbong, 2000)  
Comfort en welvaart namen toe, het milieu werd minder belast  
De ontdekking van de aardgasbel van Slochteren op 22 juli 1959 was een bepalend moment voor de energievoorzie-
ning in Nederland. Nederland veranderde van een delfstoffenarm naar een delfstoffenrijk land. Voor de transitie lag er 
een (stads)gasnet dat bijna 70% van de huishoudens bereikte, voornamelijk voor koken. In h oog tempo werd na de 
ontdekking een landelijk gasnet aangelegd waarmee heel Nederland van aardgas kon worden voorzien, niet alleen om 
te koken maar ook voor de verwarming van huizen en gebouwen, gebruik in de industrie en voor de opwekking van 
elektricitei t. De Gasunie begon in 1963 met het bestaande net van ongeveer 3000 kilometer. In de jaren daarna werd 
dit net telkens uitgebreid tot 6250 kilometer in 1975. Nederland was daarmee het land met de grootste dicht heid in 
gasleidingen ter wereld. Ongeveer 95%  van de huishoudens in Nederland kan beschikken over aardgas.  
Mede door het gebruik van het Gronings aardgas steeg het welvaartsniveau en daarmee het energieverbruik van huis -
houdens enorm. Aardgas leverde de verbruiker meer comfort en een hogere veilighe id op. Het betekende geen ge sleep 
meer met kolen of een grote olietank in tuin of schuur, weinig onderhoud aan de installatie en een gemakkelijke regeling 
van de temperatuur. De binnenstedelijke milieuvervuiling van de stadgasfabrieken kwam tot een einde en het risico op 
koolmonoxidevergiftiging nam sterk af.  
Landelijke coördinatie en voorbereiding  
Doordat het Groningse aardgas een andere samenstelling had dan het kolengas of stadsgas, moesten in Nederland 
ongeveer 5 miljoen kook - en verwarmingstoestellen worden vervangen of omgebouwd. Deze operatie moest gelijktijdig 
plaatsvinden met de aanleg van de hoofdtransportleiding zodat direct kon worden overgeschakeld, wanneer het aard gas 
werd aangevoerd. Een goede coördinatie was dus noodzakelijk.  
Hiervoor kwam een Commissie Planning Ombouw tot stand. Via vragenformulieren aan de distributiebedrijven, waarin 
werd gevraagd naar o.a. het aantal om te bouwen aansluitingen, en de planning per gemeente, vormde deze Commissie 
zich een beeld. Eind  1964 was een hoofdombouwplan gereed waarin de volgorde werd vastgelegd waarin de 
gemeenten voor ombouw in aanmerking kwamen, de aard van de werkzaamheden en de tijd die dat zou vergen. Een 
werkgroep had zich inmiddels beziggehouden met het opstellen van een compleet overzicht van alle circa 5000 typen 
kook- en verwarmingstoestellen die in Nederland in gebruik waren. Voorafgaand aan de echte ombouw gingen 
enquêteurs de huizen af om na te gaan welke apparatuur de bewoners in huis hadden.  
Inzet van ervarings deskundigen  
Het plan voor de transitie van het gasnet en de aanleg van de hoofdtransportleiding werd door vier medewerkers van 
Esso binnen twee maanden opgesteld op basis van ervaring in de Verenigde Staten. Een groot deel van het specialis -
tische werk, zo als het buigen, lassen, bekleden en neerlaten van de pijpen en het met röntgenonderzoek controleren van 
de rondlassen, werd uitgevoerd door buitenlandse bedrijven die daar ervaring mee hadden. Eenvoudiger werk, zoals 
het vrijmaken van de strook waar de lei ding moest komen, het graven en vullen van de sleuven en het in de oude staat 
brengen van het terrein, werd overgelaten aan Nederlandse aannemers.  
Het aantal gastoestellen dat moest worden omgebouwd, bedroeg circa 3,3 miljoen. Ongeveer 1,7 miljoen oude ga s-
toestellen werden ingeruild voor nieuwe. Bij de ombouw werd nauw samengewerkt met Amerikaanse bedrijven. Men 
ging er -terecht - vanuit dat de ombouwoperatie met gebruikmaking van de in de Verenigde Staten succesvol toege paste 
conversiesets zonder veel mo eilijkheden binnen vijf jaar kon worden voltooid.  
Ontzorging burger  
De werkzaamheden werden begeleid door een uitgebreide voorlichtingscampagne, waarin het publiek kreeg uitgelegd 
wat er ging gebeuren en op welke manier. De planners van de ombouw probee rden er steeds voor te zorgen dat de 
overgang van stads - op aardgas zo snel mogelijk plaatsvond. Wanneer er al eens iets fout ging, kon men meestal het 
probleem oplossen door burgers een tijdelijk alternatief te bieden. Zo bood men in Schiedam gezinnen met  baby’s 
elektrische zuigfleswarmers aan toen het aardgas een dag langer op zich liet wachten.  
Geen financiële bijdrage burgers  
De totale kosten van de operatie, die ruim binnen de daarvoor geplande termijn van vijf jaar werd afgerond, bedroe gen 
ongeveer 650 miljoen gulden. Om te voorko men dat grote aantallen mensen zouden weigeren mee te werken, was 
besloten dat de distributiebedrijven de kosten zouden dragen. Ter compensatie kregen die bedrijven per omgebouwde 
aansluiting 50 gulden van de Gasunie ver goed. Van de burger was geen financiële bijdrage nodig. De mensen kregen 
juist de mogelijkheid om oude toestellen in te ruilen voor nieuwe. Hiervoor werden hoge inruilpremies voor oude toestellen 
betaald.

 Optimaal inspelen op  het adaptief vermogen en de transitiebereidheid betekent  rekening houden 
met factoren  die weerstand oproepen . Naast maatregelen  om de transitiehobbels te nemen  zoals 
een g oede communicatie en informatievoorziening , zou meer aandacht gegeven kunnen worden 
aan het voorkomen van transitiedrempels . Er is behoefte aan een gedegen inhoudelijk plan dat 
uitgaat van principes van 1) keuzevrijheid voor de burger  en 2) kosteneffectieve maatregelen  voor 
iedereen  én tegelijkertijd de klimaatdoelen haalt.  Deze principes kunnen de belangrijkste oorzaken 
voor weerstand  wegnemen , nl. het ‘verlies aan controle ’ (niet zelf kunnen kiezen ) en ‘een 
daadwerkelijke bedreiging’ (geen passend of betaalbaar alternatief) . Uitgangspunten van het plan 
zijn dan:  
1. Voor iedereen een passende oplossing die betaalbaar, duurzaam en betrouwbaar is . 
Daardoor kunnen de kosten van grootschalige participatie - en overlegtrajecten worden 
beperkt, en hoeven groepen zonder ervaring met energievraagstukken niet zelf het wiel uit 
te vinden ( principes van keuzevrijheid en kosteneffectieve maatregelen ). Dit betekent ook:  
a) Een overgang naar een (collectieve) alternatieve oplossing alleen wanneer voldoende zeker is dat dit de meest aantrekkelijke oplossing is, waar iedereen achter staat.  
b) Ruimte  voor individueel of lokaal initiatief om te kiezen voor een warmteoplossing 
die men zelf aantrekkelijk vindt . Voor innovators  en early adopters  is het in dat 
geval mogelijk om voorop te lopen en een voorbeeld te zijn voor buurtbewoners.  
2. Focus op rendabele  en autonome isolatiestappen van bestaande woningen. K euze v oor 
isolatiemaatregelen gaat dan meer op eigen initiatief en de  besparing op de energiekosten 
betaalt de investeringen terug  (principes van keuzevrijheid en kosteneffectieve 
maatregelen ). 
3. Vrijheid  bij het bepalen (en mogelijke faseren) van het individuele overstapmoment  naar 
een duurzame warmtevoorziening . Op natuurlijke vervangingsmomenten en bij logische 
fasering is de investeringsbereidheid groter , de risico’s kleiner  en wordt het adaptief 
vermo gen minder aangesproken  (principes van keuzevrijheid en kosteneffectieve 
maatregelen ).

 HOOFDSTUK 3    EEN PASSENDE OPLOSSING VOOR IEDEREEN  
Het eerste uitgangspunt  om de transitiebereid -
heid te vergroten  is het aanbieden van een 
goed doordachte basisoplossing voor de ener -
gievraag van de gebouwde omgeving die be -
taalbaar, duurzaam en betrouwbaar is. Dit be -
tekent geen verplichte overstap naar een ver -
warm ingsalternatief, maar wel de ruimte om 
een eigen ke uze te maken.  
Vertrekpunt huidige vraag  
De energievraag in de gebouwde omgeving 
bestaat uit een elektriciteitsvraag en een warm -
tevraag.6 De finale elektriciteitsvraag van wo -
ningen is 82 petajoules (PJ)7 (CBS 2018) en de warmtevraag 324 PJ.8 Voor de verdeling zie de 
Figuur hiernaast.  
Verduurzaming elektriciteitsvraag voor gebruiker relatief ongemerkt  
Richting 2050 zal de elektriciteit svraag  voor verlichting en elektrische apparatuur ongeveer gelijk 
blijven. De groei door de toename van de bevo lking en het gebruik van elektrische apparatuur 
wordt naar verwachting gecompenseerd do or efficiëntieverbeteringen. De benodigde elektriciteit 
zal in 2050 volledig hernieuwbaar moeten worden opgewekt. Achter de voordeur zijn  hiervoor 
geen aanpas singen nodi g. Uit een stopcontact komt in 2050 volledig CO 2-vrije ‘groene’ stroom. 
Het gevolg van de verduurzaming zal zijn dat de leefomgeving verandert, met meer windparken 
en zonneparken en meer huizen met zonnepanelen op het dak.  
Verduurzaming warmtevraag doet g root beroep op adaptief vermogen  
De warmtevraag bestaat voor het merendeel uit warmte voor ruimteverwarming, voor een deel uit 
tapwater en een klein deel uit koken. In hoeverre de vraag verandert , hangt sterk af van de isolatie -
inspanning en de ontwikkeling van het aantal huishoudens en woningen.  
Er zijn verschillende energiebronnen die de warmtevraag kunnen invullen. Ze kunnen worden 
ingedeeld naar hun vorm en temperatuurbereik (zie Figuur 6): 
 
6 In het klimaatakkoord valt de warmtevraag van  woningen en gebouwen onder ‘gebouwde omgeving’ en het 
elektriciteitsgebruik van de gebouwde omgeving onder ‘elektriciteit’.  
7 Dit komt overeen met 22,77 miljard kilowattuur (kWh). 1 PJ is gelijk aan 109 megajoules. Een kWh is 3,6 
megajoules.  
8 Het a ardgasgebruik in PJ is afkomstig uit CBS -energiebalans. Omzetting tussen m3 en petajoules (PJ) gebeurt 
op basis van  de lage verbrandingswaarde van Groningsgas: 31,65 MJ/m3.

 1. De mogelijke vormen van energie  (energiedragers), nl. elektriciteit (de elektronen), warmte (via 
een warmtenet) en gas (de moleculen). Afhankelijk van de vorm is niet alleen een andere 
verwarmingsinstallatie in huis nodig maar ook een ander e transport-  en distributie -infrastructuur.   
2. De mogelijke watertemperatuur  waarmee de woning verwarmd kan worden. Het gebruik van 
sommige warmte bronnen vraagt om een lagetemperatuurwarmtesysteem. Bij warmte op 50°C 
of lager zijn LT -radiatoren nodig (PBL, oktober 2019)  en is een hoge isolatiegraad vereist om 
de woning warm te kunnen stoken (minimaal energielabel B).  
De benodigde hoge isolatiegraad heeft twee oorzaken:  
a) In tochtige woningen kan een doorsnee warmtepomp of LT -systeem  niet snel genoeg 
warmte produceren om de woni ng warm te krijgen in een koude winter; en  
b) Bij slechte isolatie is het energie verbruik hoger, waardoor het snel erg duur wordt.  
Er is nog te weinig ervaring met LT -verwarming in de bestaande bouw om vast te stellen hoeveel 
schilisolatie minimaal noodzakel ijk is. In de Startanalyse neemt PBL aan dat schillabel B voldoende 
is (PBL, oktober 2019) . Deze aanname is door deskundigen gevalideerd, maar of dat klopt,  moet 
in de praktijk nog blijken. Mogelijk is een hoger isolatieniveau (A en hoger) noodzakelijk.  
 
Figuur 6:  energiedragers, duurzame energiebronnen en installatieopties  
De verduurzaming van de warmtevraag  gaat niet vanzelf . Om een woning bijvoorbeeld geschikt 
te maken voor LT -verwarming  zijn stevige isolatiemaatregelen nodig. Overstap  op een andere 
energiedrager (een systeemverandering)  vereist  aanpassingen aan installaties en aansluitingen . 
Alleen bij oplossingen waarbij het bestaande warmteafgiftesysteem gehandhaafd kan wo rden 
(zoals bij voortzetting van een HT -warmtenet en de levering van hernieuwbaar gas via het gasnet ) 
zijn voor de meeste woningen de veranderingen beperkt. Deze studie naar een laagdrempelige  
energietransitie richt zich daarom vooral op de warmtevraag  in woningen . De verduurzaming van 
de elektriciteitsvraag zal voor het grootste deel plaatsvinden  zonder dat bewoners zelf actie moeten 
ondernemen .

 3.1 MOGELIJKE ALTERNATIEVEN  VOOR DE WARMTE VOORZIENING  
Er zijn vier  hoofd installatie -opties mogelijk om de woning te verwarmen  (zie Figuur 6) en een 
combinatie  van een warmtepomp (optie 1) met een cv -ketel (optie 4), de zogenaamde hybride 
warmtepomp.  Dit zijn ook de vijf opties die PBL in zijn modellen voor de gemeenten heeft 
opgen omen.  
Kader 3:  overzicht van de beschouwde verwarmings alternatieven  
Verwarmingsalternatieven  
Optie 1: Warmtepomp  (all electric ). Een warmtepomp combineert warmte  uit de buitenlucht (of bodem) met elektrische 
energie om zo zeer efficiënt warmte te produceren voor ruimteverwarming en tapwater. Er is geen gasaansluiting meer 
nodig, maar wel een zwaardere elektriciteitsaansluiting. Een warmtepomp werkt doorgaans met een 
verwarmingstemperatuur van maximaal 45 tot 55 °C. Dat is lager dan de afgiftetemperatuur van een hr -ketel (80 °C). 
Door de lagere temperatuur van het LT -warmteafgiftesysteem (de LT-radiatoren  of vloerverwarming ) wordt een elektrische 
warmtepomp eigenlijk altijd toegepast in  goed geïsoleerde woningen (minimaal schillabel B ) in combinatie met een 
boilervat (opslag voor tapwater) en ventilatiewarmteterugwinning . Koken gebeurt elektrisch.  
Optie 2: LT -warmtenet : Optie 2 is verwarming via een warmtenet op basis van LT -warmtebronnen. De lage temperatuur 
houdt in een temperatuur tot 50 °C. Voor onderhoud, leveringszekerheid en piekvraag zijn centrale back -up ketels vaak 
noodzakelijk. Deze ketels gebruiken dan herni euwbaar gas. Bij warmtelevering op LT -niveau zijn de distributieverliezen 
lager dan bij hoge temperatuur, maar komt er in elk aan te sluiten gebouw of woning een boosterwarmtepomp en 
opslagvat voor de warmtapwatervoorziening. Er zijn meer aanpassingen nodi g in de gebouwen, zoals een LT-
afgiftesysteem voor het leveren van genoeg warmte bij de lagere temperatuur en voldoende isolatie. Bij de gebruikers 
van een warmtenet wordt  de gasaansluiting  vervangen door een afleverset warmte , en is vaak een aanpassing no dig om 
over te kunnen gaan op elektrisch koken. Warmtenetten met een LT -bron kunnen meestal wat kleiner zijn dan met een HT -
bron en lenen zich voor een aanpak binnen één wijk. Door het relatief dure distributienet is een warmtenet vooral 
toepasbaar bij dic hte bebouwing. Er zijn talloze mogelijkheden om de LT -warmtebronnen in te zetten en te combineren 
of op te waarderen naar HT -warmte.  
Optie 3: HT -warmtenet: Bij de 3e optie wordt de warmtevraag van woningen en gebouwen geleverd via een aansluiting 
op een warmtenet dat warmte op HT -niveau9 levert vanuit een collectieve warmtebron met een temperatuur die 
voldoende is om bij de eindgebruiker water van minimaal 70 °C te leveren. Door  deze temperatuur  kan direct tapwater 
worden gemaakt. De gasaansluiting vervalt en voor koken moet men  overgaan op elektrisch . Isolatie in de woning is niet 
nodig , enkel een afleverset warmte en een reguliere elektriciteitsaansluiting . Door het relatief dure distributienet is een 
warmtenet vooral toepasbaar bij dichte bebouwing.  
Optie 4: Ketel op hernieuwbaar gas (4a. groen gas, 4b. waterstof). Alternatief 4 houdt in dat een reguliere hr -ketel 
warmte levert en het gasnet in gebruik blijft. Bij deze strategie zijn er nauwelijks aanpassingen nodig. De hernieuwbare 
gassen kunnen via het bestaande gasnet geleverd worden. Waterstof is voorlopig nog niet leverbaar aan de gebouwde 
omgeving (behalve bij enkele pilots). Na 2030 zou dit wel het geval kunnen zijn. Naast ‘puur’ gebruik kan waterstof 
worden bijgemengd bij aardgas of groen gas. Moderne cv -ketels en gasfornuizen kunnen naar verwachting zonder 
problemen tot 20% bijmenging van waterstof aan. Oude apparaten kunnen dit niet zomaar. Voor 100% verbranding op 
waterstof is een aangepaste ketel nodig. Wettelijk is bijmenging tot  0,5% toege staan. Isolatie of andere aanpassingen in 
de woning zijn nauwelijks nodig. Waterstof vereist aanpassing van  de gasmeter . Voor groen gas is er geen enkele 
aanpassing in huis nodig.  
Optie 5: Hybride gas/warmtepomp (5a. groen gas, 5b. waterstof). Een hr-ketel op hernieuwbaar gas gecombineerd met 
een warmtepomp combineert  de voordelen van optie 1 en 4 . Met een hybride oplossing  kan je de warmtevraag 
gedeeltelijk elektrificeren en efficiënt warmte produceren. Doordat de ketel bijspringt wanneer er tijdelijk veel capaciteit 
nodig is, is extra isolatie  of netverzwaring niet  nodig . Waterstof (optie 5b) vereist aanpassing van  de gasmeter en een 
ketel geschikt voor verbranding van waterstof . Voor groen gas (optie 5a) is er geen enkele aanpassing in huis nodig. 
Isolatie is niet nodig maar vergroot wel het rendement doordat  het aandeel van gas in het energiegebruik  lager uitvalt.  
 
9 Naast HT - en LT-warmtenetten zijn er warmtenetten op  een middentemperatuur  mogelijk. De  temperatuur ligt 
wat lager dan bij de meeste bestaande  HT-warmtenetten. Daardoor wordt het makkelijker duurzame bronnen 
aan te sluiten en zijn de distributieverliezen in het warmtenet wat lager. Wel is een hogere schilisolatie nodig 
om de woning met de bestaande radiatoren warm te krijgen en het gewenste comfort te bereiken.  Een Laagdrempelige Energietransitie Stratelligence  
15 
 Bij optie 4 en 5 maken we onderscheid in groen gas10 (4a en 5a) en waterstof (4b en 5b). Al deze 
alternatieven (zie  Kader 3) moeten 100% CO 2-neutraal kunnen worden voor 2050. De 
HT(hogetemperatuur)-  en LT-warmtenetten dekken meerdere warmtebronnen en varianten af. Voor 
de gebruiker en de transitiebereidheid  is de impact van die verschillen beperkt.  
3.2 VERSCHILLEN IN HET EFFECT OP HET ADAPTIEF VERMOGEN  
In Figuur 7 zijn de verschillen tussen de duurzame opties indicatief in kaart gebracht. Als een o ptie 
heel goed scoort op een bepaald aspect krijgt dit de beoordeling ‘groen’. Iets minder goed wordt 
‘lichtgroen’, enzovoorts. Hoe beter de score des te minder zal het adaptief vermogen worden 
aangesproken.  Een korte toelichting is te vinden in Tabel 3. 
Optelling van de sc ores per optie is niet mogelijk doordat de weging van de verschillende aspecten per 
woning zal verschillen. De eerste indruk kan daarom  een vertekend beeld geven. Bovendien is hier alleen 
rekening gehouden met aspecten relevant voor bewoners . Zo zien de opties aan de rechterkant er gunstig uit, 
maar is er op dit moment  onvoldoend e aanbod. Bij de twee LT-opties vallen er  ‘rode’ beoordelingen weg als 
er al goed geïsol eerd is. Ook a utonomie en keuze van het overstapmoment zijn soms minder of niet relevant .

 Tabel 3:  korte toelichting beoordeling per aspect  
Isolatiekosten  Goede isolatie en een LT-warmte afgiftesyst eem zijn  noodzakelijk voor een warmtepomp en een 
LT-warmtenet . 
Energiekosten  De energiekosten  van een warmtepomp zijn het meest gunstig door het hoge rendement. De k os-
ten van waterstof zijn het hoogst, gevolgd door groen gas , maar ze  zullen naar verwachting 
dalen . 
Installatiekosten  Een HT-warmtenet heeft de laagste k osten vanwege de investering en het onderhoud van enkel 
een afleverset. Een reguliere cv-ketel is per jaar ongeveer  even duur. Een LT-warm tenet heeft iets 
hogere k osten vanwege  de boosterwarmte -pomp en het tapwatervat.  De hoogste kosten zijn voor 
de warmtepomp. De kosten van een hybride oplossing lig gen tussen een ketel en warmtepomp in.  
Netwerkkosten  De laagste kosten  zijn voor de  warmtepomp doordat de meerkosten van netverzwaring meer dan 
gecompenseerd worden  door het wegvallen van de gasaansluiting. Een w armtenet heeft de hoog-
ste kosten. Een kleinere omvang van een LT -warmtenet betekent  gemiddeld iets lagere kosten . 
Gasoplossingen komen op iets hogere kosten uit  door kleine aanpassingen aan het gasnet.  
Autonomie  De collectieve oplossingen verhinderen  een individuele keuze  voor een techniek . 
Keuze overstapmo -
ment Bij collectieve oplossingen is geen individuele keuze van het overstapmoment  mogelijk . Voor her -
nieuwbare gassen is daadwerkelijk gebruik van hernieuwbaar gas afhankelijk van de levering via 
het gasnet.  
Aanpassingen en 
overlast  Bij de noodzaak voor isolatie zijn veel aanpassingen  nodig , bij een warmtenet mogelijk aanpas -
sing van leidingen, bij een warmtepomp en hybride oplossing de plaatsing van een buitenunit, bij 
waterstof aanpassing van de gasmeter . 
Ruimtegebruik De meeste ruimte vragen LT -oplossingen vooral vanwege het tapwater vat, de  minste ruimte  in huis  
is nodig voor een HT-warmtenet.  
Comfort  Verlies aan comfort treedt op bij  geluidsproductie van een warmtepomp ( -), voor LT -oplossingen 
langzame verwarming/ tapwate rproduc tie (-), en niet voldoende kunnen verwarmen bij grote kou 
(-). Er is een voordeel van koeling bij sommige warmtepompen (+).  
Risico  Warmtenetten hebben verhoogd risico door één aanbieder (prijsstijging) en wegvallen warmte -
bron. Risico op wegvallen warmtebron is groter bij een HT-warmtenet dan  bij een LT-warmtenet. 
Hybride oplossing  kan enigszins  optimaliseren  tussen elektriciteit  en gas afhankelijk  van de 
energie prijzen.  
3.3 OPLOSSINGEN PASSEN D BIJ EEN LAAGDREMPELIGE  ENERGIETRANSITIE 
Het is het meest aantrekkelijk gezien vanuit het adaptief vermogen  als er geen verandering optreedt 
in de energievorm en als  de watertemperatuur van de warmtevoorziening  niet dwingt tot isoleren  
of aanpassing en (zie Figuur 7). De energietransitie levert dan de minste transitiedrempels op.  Een 
oplossing die weinig aanspraak maakt op het adaptief vermogen zou eruit kunnen zien als getoond 
in Tabel 4. 
Een woning die nu al op stadswarmte is aangesloten, blijft warmte via een warmtenet gebruiken. Woningen die goed geïsoleerd zijn, zouden kunnen overgaan op LT - in plaats van HT -verwarming.  
Voor een bewoner die nu nog op gas verwarmt, kan een keuze voor hernieuwbaar gas (optie 4 en 5) de sociale acceptatie en implementatiesnelheid van de transitie verhogen. Burgers zijn immers al bekend m et gasgestookte ketels en boilers. Er hoeft geen nieuwe infrastructuur te worden 
aangelegd. En de bestaande schilisolatie hoeft niet te worden aangepast. Overstap naar individuele elektrische verwarming is waarschijnlijk geen groot probleem voor reeds goed  
geïsoleerde bouw die al geschikt is voor LT -verwarming. Een elektriciteitsaansluiting is al aanwezig 
en er zijn geen aanpassingen aan de woning nodig anders dan de aanleg van de warmtepomp, maar ook het gebruik van hernieuwbaar gas blijft aantrekkelijk.  
Voor nieuwbouw die immers al goed geïsoleerd moet zijn en geen gasaansluiting meer krijgt, komt 
naast een warmtepomp een LT -warmtenet in aanmerking. Wanneer een corporatie een groot deel 
van de woningen bezit, is een warmtenet aantrekkelijker dan bij een g root aandeel koopwoningen. Een Laagdrempelige Energietransitie Stratelligence  
17 
 Autonomie en de individuele keuze van het overstapmoment wegen dan wat minder zwaar, hoewel 
de corporatie ook instemming van 70% van de bewoners nodig heeft.

ketel met hernieuwbaar gas, 5) hybride oplossing.  
Afhankelijk van het energiegebruik en de locatie van de woning is verdere detaillering mogelijk.  
Voor woningen met een laag energiegebruik kan de investering vaak niet uit in een optie met hoge installatiekosten. Hierdoor is een warmtepomp minder aantrekk elijk en weegt de energiebesparing 
van een hybride oplossing niet op tegen de extra investering ten opzichte van een reguliere cv -
ketel. Voor woningen die veel energie gebruiken is de besparing op de variabele energiekosten juist voldoende om een hogere in vestering voor een (hybride) warmtepomp te rechtvaardigen. Voor 
grotere afnemers (met vaak grotere woningen) zijn er bovendien meer mogelijkheden om een warmtepomp te plaatsen.  
Door de relatief hoge distributiekosten van een collectieve warmte oplossing  en het minimumaantal  
afnemers zijn deze oplossingen  vooral toepasbaar bij dichte bebouwing (veel aansluitingen per 
vierkante k ilometer ). Voor landelijke gebieden of vrijstaande woningen met een grote afstand tot 
andere afnemers zijn de netwerkkosten (te) hoog . Een duurzaam HT -warmtenet heeft een hogere 
minimum capaciteit dan een LT -warmtenet. Daardoor is een HT -warmtenet vooral geschikt voor de 
stedelijke omgeving. Een LT -warmtenet kan bij kleinere concentraties , goed geïsoleerde woningen 
worden toegepast.  
Samenvattend zijn elektrische toepassingen geschikt voor alle woningen  mits voldoende geïsoleerd . 
HT-warmtenetten zijn ideaal  voor stedelijke gebieden die nu al stadswarmte hebben . LT-
warmtenetten passen goed bij kleine concentraties, goed geïsoleerde woningen.  En gasoplossingen 
passen bij  alle locaties en isolatienivea us, met uitzondering van nieuwbouw en woningen die al

 3.4 OPTIMALE OPLOSSING NIET DIRECT  REALISEERBAAR  
Om de ideale oplossing vanuit het perspectief  van de laagdrempelige  energietransitie te realiseren, 
moet aan de volgende criteria worden voldaan:  
• Het aanbod duurzame energie is voldoende om de energievraag in te vullen ; 
• De oplossing maakt het mogelijk om de klimaatdoelen tijdig te halen;  
• De oplossing heeft een vergelijkba re prijs voor iedereen.  
Potentieel aanbod  
Niet voor alle energiedragers is er op dit moment voldoende aanbod. Voor de all -electric -optie lijkt 
het potentiële aanbod voor de gebouwde omgeving voldoende, ook al moet het aanbod worden 
gedeeld met het elektric iteitsgebruik voor verlichting en apparatuur  en de vraag van mobiliteit en 
de industrie. In de prognoses voor 2050 is Nederland in staat meer elektriciteit op te wekken dan 
het hiervoor nodig heeft, mits elektriciteit efficiënt  opgeslagen kan worden om de seizoensonbalans 
op te lossen. Het potentieel van LT -warmtebronnen hoeft niet te worden gedeeld en is niet beperk t. 
Voor een HT-warmtenet  is onzeker of er voldoende warmtebronnen zijn. Naar  geothermie, 
restwarmte en biomassa bestaat vraag uit andere sectoren. Warmtebronnen als geothermie en restwarmte zijn niet on beperkt  en niet overal  beschikbaar . Ze lenen zich vooral voor regionale 
toepassing .  
Het potentieel aan groen gas en waterstof lij kt zonder import onvoldoende om aardgas in de 
industrie en de gebouwde omgeving volledig te vervangen. De huidige productie van groen gas is 
beperkt (0,1 miljard m³ in 2018)  en waterstof is in de gebouwde omgeving alleen voor enkel e 
pilots beschikbaar . Dit is een klein volume in vergelijking met de 1 0 miljard m³ aardgas die 
momenteel voor woningen gebruikt wordt. Wel zijn er  flinke groeiambities. De realisatie van deze 
ambitie s is echter onzeker en deels gebaseerd op de doorbraak van technologieën en 
kosten reductie. Keuze voor  een hybride  oplossing kan helpen doordat minder gas nodig  is dan bij 
gebruik van alleen een cv -ketel.  
CO
2-uitstoot  
In 2050 zijn alle beschouwde warmteoplossingen energieneutraal. Tot dat moment varieert d e 
uitstoot van CO 2 tussen de opties. Dit is relevant voor het tussendoel in 2030. Doordat de 
elektriciteitsmix en efficiëntie  van de opties verbeteren, neemt de CO 2-uitstoot per hoeveelheid 
energie af. Gebruik van elektriciteit levert vanaf 2030 veel minder uitstoot op en is volledig CO 2-
neutraal in 2050. Een warmtepomp en hybride oplossing besparen op de uitstoot doordat ze 
omgevingswarmte benutten. LT -warmtenetten maken vooral gebruik van duurzame bronnen; wel 
gebruiken ze ook  elektriciteit die nog niet volledig CO 2-neutraal is om het water rond te pompen 
en gas voor de piekverwarming en als back -up. Bij HT -warmtenetten is nu nog niet alle warmte 
duurzaam en is elektriciteit en meestal gas nodig voor de piekcapaciteit. Groen gas is CO 2-
neutraal, maar voor waterstof geldt dat nog niet. D e CO 2-uitstoot bij de productie van waterstof telt Een Laagdrempelige Energietransitie Stratelligence  
19 
 
mee. Pas als d e elektriciteit  gebruikt bij de elektrolyse van water 100% groen is, is de waterstof dat 
ook. Tussen 2030 en 2050 zal dat moment optreden.11  
Prijsuniformiteit ; een vergelijkbare eerlijke prijs voor iedereen?  
Afwachten totdat er  voldoende hernieuwbaar gas beschikbaar komt voor de ideale laagdrempelige 
energietransitie is geen optie, omdat dan de tussendoelen in gevaar komen. Als woningen die nu 
een gasaansluiting hebben , echter  worden gedwongen  een andere minder optimale oplossing te 
kiezen , betekent dit een aanslag op het adaptief vermogen en niet voor iedereen leidt dat tot een 
vergelijkbare en eerlijke prijs.  
Bewoners van  minder goed geïsoleerde woning en bij wie  vergaan de isolatie niet rendabel of mo -
gelijk is, kunnen niet overstappen naar LT -alternatieven of alleen tegen hoge kosten voor woning -
aanpassing. Een rendabele aanleg van een HT -warmtenet is vaak ook niet mogelijk, wanneer  deze 
woningen  buiten de stedelijke geb ieden of in stedelijke gebieden zonder  duurzame HT-warmtebron 
liggen .  
Voor w oningen die wel op een warmtenet aangesloten kunnen worden , zullen de kosten variëren 
afhankelijk van de locatie, schaal, warmtebron enzovoorts. Zolang de meer - en minderkosten ni et 
gesocialiseerd worden , kan dit tot grote verschillen leiden. Dit wijkt af van hoe we tot nu toe met 
de kosten van gas - en elektriciteit sinfrastructuur  zijn omgegaan. Het is de vraag of dit gewenst is.12 
Bij overstap naar een LT -warmten et kan men te make n krijgen met kosten van een  noodzakelijke 
isolatie.  
Oplossingen die voor iedereen beschikbaar zijn, en tegen een vergelijkbare prijs, zijn alternatieven 
waarin de cv -ketel blijft of vervangen wordt door een hybride systeem. Bij gebruikers met nu een -
zelfde gasverbruik valt dan een duurzame energierekening even hoog uit. Echter het aanbod 
hiervan maakt toepassing nog niet mogelijk . 
 
        
Figuur 8:  kwalitatieve vergelijking algemene criteria  
Een optimale oplossing vanuit het perspectief van het adaptief  vermogen  is dan ook niet op korte 
termijn voor iedereen realiseerbaar  (zie Figuur 8). Maar misschien is het wel mogelijk de 
mogelijkheden  van isolatie te gebruiken. H et volgende hoofdstuk gaat hierop in . 
 
11 De CO 2-uitstoot kan gewaardeerd worden door deze te vermenigvuldigen met de efficiënte CO 2-prijs. Deze 
neemt over verloop van tijd toe. In 2050 is die in het hoge WLO- scenario € 160 per ton CO 2 (CPB/PBL, maart 
2016) . Voor aardgas bedragen de CO 2-kosten dan € 0,29 per m3 (56,6 kg CO 2 per GJ aardgas x 0,001 
GJ/MJ x 31,65 MJ/m3 x € 0,16 per kg = € 0,29 per m3).

 HOOFDSTUK 4    FOCUS OP R ENDABELE EN AUTONOME ISOLATIE  
In het vorige hoofdstuk hebben we geconstateerd dat de haalbaarheid van de ideale basisoplossing 
voor een laagdrempelige  energietransitie onzeker is vanwege het beperkte aanbod van 
hernieuwbaar gas. Dit betekent dat we misschien keuzes moeten maken  die een groot beroep doen 
op het adaptief vermogen en daardoor minder ge makkelijk geaccepteerd worden. Door isolatie is 
het wellicht mogelijk om de energievraag voldoende te reduceren  en komen  de 2030 -doelen toch 
binnen bereik. Een besp aring van 25% op het fossiele energiegebruik is immers  een besparing van 
25% op de uitstoot van CO 2. Het potentieel hiervan beschouwen we in dit hoofdstuk.  
Tabel 5:  verdeling geregistreerde energielabels (bijna 50% woningen heeft e nergielabel)13 
Energielabel  GJ/m2 RVO (geregistreerde 
labels)  
BENG/A+/A++  Minder dan 0,7  0%

D Minder dan 2,0  16% 
E Minder dan 2,4  9% 
F Minder dan 2,9  6% 
G Meer dan 2,9  4% 
De isolatiegraad van woningen wordt uitgedrukt in het energielabel. Het energielabel is een 
maatstaf om te zien hoe zuinig en/of energiebesparend een gebouw of woning is.14 Een woning 
met een A++ -label verbruikt in theorie vier keer zo weinig energie als een woning met een D -label. 
Een groot deel van de woningvoorraad kan nog verder geïsoleerd  worden (zie Tabel 5). 
 
13 Bij verkoop of verhuur van een woning is sinds 1 januari 2015 een energielabel verplicht. Doordat sindsdien 
nog niet alle woningen van eigenaar zijn veranderd of opnieuw verhuurd, is niet voor alle woningen een 
definitief label bekend. Voor deze studie gaan we uit van de meest recente geregistreerde labels.  We nemen 
aan dat de geregistreerde verdeling representatief is.  
14 Er wordt geschat hoeveel gigajoules (GJ) energie de woning elk jaar p er vierkante meter gebruikt voor 
verwarming, warm water en verlichting. Hiervan wordt afgetrokken de geschatte warmteterugwinning uit 
rioolwater en ventilatie, en de geschatte energieproductie via zonnecollectoren. Er wordt uitgegaan van 
gemiddelde bewonin g, gemiddeld buitenklimaat en gemiddeld stookgedrag. Het daadwerkelijke gebruik van 
iemand die 's nachts en tijdens werkuren de verwarming laag zet, is meestal veel minder dan het label suggereert.  Een Laagdrempelige Energietransitie Stratelligence  
21 
 4.1 POTENTIEEL VOOR REDUCTIE VAN HET GASGEBRUIK  
Het type woning en de bouwperiode (zie Figuur 9) hebben een grote invloed op het energiegebruik. 
Een vrijstaande woning heeft nu eenmaal een g rotere warmtebehoefte dan een appartement. En 
een vooroorlogse woning heeft een grotere warmtebehoefte dan een nieuwbouwwoning door de 
lagere isolatiegraad. Woningen uit de periode 19 65-2000  zijn beperkt geïsoleerd (energielabel 
C en D). De woningvoorraad voor die tijd heeft vaak een lager energielabel (E t/m G). Woningen 
van na 2000 hebben meestal een energielabel B of hoger. Dit heeft te maken met de eisen die sindsdien zijn gesteld aan de nieuwbouw. Nieuwbouw voegt vanaf nu per definitie gasloze 
woningen  toe aan de bovenkant van het spectrum omdat dat verplicht is.  
 
Figuur 9:  verdeling bestaande woningen naar categorie en periode (indeling Vestamodel) en verloop 
bestaande woningen ten opzichte van nieuwbouw  
Tot 2050 zal de woni ngvoorraad zich uitbreiden met nieuwbouw en zal een deel van de bestaande 
voorraad worden gesloopt of onttrokken (zie Figuur 9). Dit wil niet zeggen dat de isolatiegraad 
vanzelf sterk verbetert . Het aandeel sloop is zeer beperkt. Voor huurwoningen ligt dat op 0,5% per 
jaar en bij koopwoningen 0,1% per jaar  (EIB, mei 2018) . Nieuwbouw is grotendeels nodig om de 
toename van het aantal huishoudens op te vangen.15 Ook in 2050 zal het merendeel van de vraag 
naar warmte bestaan uit warmte voor woningen die er nu al zijn. Qua aantal zijn ze in de 
meerderheid en de isolatiegraad ligt lager.  
4.2 ISOLATIE  TOT ENERGIELABEL C DOORGAANS KOSTENEFFECTIEF  
Is isolatie rendabel en haalbaar? Isoleren zonder dat een beroep gedaan wordt op het adaptief 
vermogen kan alleen als isoleren direct voordeel oplevert voor de eigenaar. Daarvoor zou de besparing op de energierekening groter moeten zijn dan de jaa rlijkse kosten van de benodigde 
investering in isolatie.  
De eerste stap van een zeer energie- onzuinig gebouw naar een redelijk energiezuinig gebouw is 
financieel relatief gunstig voor een eigenaar -bewoner  volgens onderzoek van het EIB  (EIB, mei 
2018) , maar een verdere verbetering naar een hoge energiezuinigheid  (hoger dan label C) is dat 
niet (zie Figuur 10, links ). Een overgang naar nieuwbouwkwaliteit of een bijna energieneutraal 
 
15 In prognoses wordt vaak uitgegaan van een gelijkblijvend  aandeel sloop/onttrekking. Het is de vraag of 
dit reëel is. Een koopwoning zou bij 0,1% sloop, gemiddeld 1000 jaar meegaan. Dit betekent dat in de 
toekomst veel meer (ver)nieuwbouw nodig is om  woning voorraad op peil te houden . Deze vervanging zal het 
isolatieniveau en de energievraag verminderen.  
Stratelligence  Een Laagdrempelige Energietransitie 
22 
 gebouw (BENG) is op dit moment onrendabel vanuit een financieel -economisch gezichtspunt. Dit 
maakt een overgang naar een vorm van LT -verwarming ongewenst vanuit het adaptief vermogen. 
Hiervoor is label  A of B noodzakelijk. Dat deze investeringen zich vaak niet terugverdienen via 
lagere energiekosten bevestig en onderzoek van TNO  (Tigchelaar, et al., 2019)  en onderzoek van 
ING (ING economisch Bureau, oktober 2019) . 
 
Figuur 10:  kosten en baten per overgang naar hoger energielabel  
Het voordeel van de lagere energiekosten van bewoners is ook  terug te vinden in de verkoopprijs 
van een woning. Een vergelijkbare woning met een hoger energielabel en lager energiegebruik 
heeft gemiddeld een hogere verkoopprijs dan een woning met een lager energielabel en hoger 
energiegebruik  (Kadaster, november 2014) , (Brounen, et al., 2011)  (DNB, 2019) .  
Vanuit het gezichtspunt van nationale kosten is het rendement van isolatie iets ongunstiger  (zie 
Figuur 10, rechts) . Btw en energiebelastingen maken meer dan de helft van de gasprijs uit, maar 
zijn voor de samenleving een herverdeling van kosten. Er wordt niet echt bespaard.  
 
Figuur 11:  break -even gasprijs die nodig is om isolatie rendabel te maken; links voor eindgebruikers, rechts op 
basis van nationale kosten  
Op termijn zullen de kosten van isolatiemaatregelen kunnen dalen en nemen de vermeden energiekosten van aardgas toe. Da t kan verdergaande isolatie wel rendabel maken . In 2030 is bij 
de verwachte nationale kosten van gas (45,6 ct. per m
3) en CO 2-kosten (14,3 ct. per m3)16 isolatie 
tot label C maatschappelijk rendabel  (zie Figuur 11). Als alle woningen naar label C zouden  
worden  gebracht kost dat  zo’n € 15 miljard ( excl. btw) en besparen we per jaar 1,8 miljard  m3 
aardgas (zie Tabel 6). Isolatie van de bestaande woningvoorraad naar hogere energielabels 
 
16 In 2030 is de efficiënte CO 2-prijs in het hoge WLO -scenario € 80 per ton CO 2 (CPB/PBL, maart 2016) . 
Voor aardgas bedragen de CO 2-kosten dan € 0,14 per m3 (56,6 kg CO 2 per GJ aardgas x 0,001 GJ/MJ x 
31,65 MJ/m3 x € 0,08 per kg = € 0,143 per m3).

4.3 VARIATIE DOOR GROTE VERSCHILLEN IN HET GEBRUIK  
Hiervoor  hebben we het steeds over gemiddelden gehad. W oning en en huishoudens  houden zich 
niet altijd aan het gemiddelde. Rondom het gemiddelde is een grote spreiding in het daadwerkelijke 
gasgebruik, ook als het verbruik wordt uitgedrukt in het verbruik per vierkante meter woning. Voor 
de meeste type woningen met een A -label heeft  90% van de woningen een gasverbruik dat ligt 
tussen 50% en 165% van het gemiddelde (zie Figuur 12). Bij de appartementen is de bandbreedte 
iets groter. Voor minder goed  geïsoleerde woningen geldt in procenten een vergelijkbare 
bandbreedte maar is het absolute verschil groter doordat het gemiddelde gebruik hoger ligt. Het 
gasverbruik van een woning met G -label ligt in praktijk ongeveer 55% tot 80% hoger dan voor een 
A-label. Dit is minder dan de energielabelverdeling suggereert . 
 
Figuur 12:  spreiding in omvang aardgasgebruik per woning  
Dit betekent dat de berekening van het energiegebruik van een gemiddelde woning lang niet alles 
zegt. Een deel van de bewoners van een A -label woning verbruikt per vierkante meter  net zoveel 
aardgas als een zuinige bewoner met een G- label woning. Voor de zuinige gebruikers za l extra 
isolatie lang niet altijd lonen  en voor de grootgebruikers juist wel .

 In het resterende aardgasgebruik van ruim 8 miljard m3 (10 miljard m3 minus 1,8 miljard m3) kan 
echter nog niet worden voorzien met hernieuwbaar gas. De potentiële rendabele bes paring op het 
aardgasgebruik is ongeveer gelijk aan het CO 2-reductiedoel voor 2030: 3,4 Mton. Het is echter 
niet verstandig aan te nemen dat alle huishoudens voor 2030 zullen isoleren tot energielabel C. 
De timing van een aanpassing moet ook een vrije keuze zijn in een laagdrempelige  
energietransitie. Het volgende hoofdstuk gaat in op de timing van aanpassingen.  
  
 
25 
 HOOFDSTUK 5    VRIJE KEUZE OVERSTAPMOMENT  
Een natuurlijk moment om na te denken over aanpassing van de warmtevoorziening is het 
vervangingsmoment van de installaties. Die vervangingsmomenten slim benutten  met een adaptieve 
aanpak , kan helpen de transitiedrempels te verlagen.  
Verwarmingsinstallatie s worden gemiddeld eens in de 15 jaar vervangen. Dat betekent dat tot 
2050 gemiddeld per woning nog twee momenten komen waarop verduurzaming van de warmtevraag aansluit bij een logisch vervangingsmoment. Dit  kunnen we gebruiken , bijvoorbeeld 
door bij het e erste vervangingsmoment nog geen definitieve  keuze te maken als de juiste keuze 
nog onzeker is en die  keuze bovendien onomkeerbare investeringen en (isolatie) aanpassingen  met 
zich meebrengt.  
5.1 
RISICO SUBOPTIMALE KEUZE BIJ VROEGTIJDIGE SYSTEEMVERANDERING  
De hoogste kosten voor de maatschappij en de eindgebruiker treden op bij een systeemverandering 
die verregaande isolatie en/of aanpassingen in huis vraagt. Een verandering van de energiedrager zou in een laagdrempelige  energietransitie alleen moeten gebeuren als er zekerheid is dat dit een 
aantrekkelijke langetermijnoplossing betreft en er steun is voor de timing van het overstapmoment. In dat geval is er zo min mogelijk overlast en sprake van een no -regret -keuze. We spreken h et 
adaptief vermogen dan zo min mo gelijk aan.  
1) Voor nieuwbouwwoningen  is de situatie helder. Er is geen sprake van een 
systeemverandering maar een initiële keuze. Dit betekent dat voor nieuwbouw kan worden ingezet op LT -verwarming op individuele basis (warmtepomp) , een collectieve 
warmtepom p bij blokverwarming , of een collectief LT -warmtesysteem. Dergelijke LT -
warmtesystemen zijn er nu nog niet zo veel, maar de ervaringen vanuit diverse pilots en proefwijken nemen snel toe. Deze keuze doet geen beroep op het adaptief vermogen , met 
dien verstande dat aangenomen is dat in nieuwbouwwoningen in het ontwerp rekening  
gehouden is met de warmtevoorziening en eventuele geluidsproductie van de warmtepomp 
geen probleem is.  
2) Woningen aangesloten op een warmtenet  hoeven geen systeemverander ing te 
ondergaan. Belangrijk is dat de warmtebron duurzaam en op de lange duur beschikbaar 
blijft. Onderzocht kan worden of aanpassing van de watertemperatuur haalbaar is zonder 
grote aanpassingen in de aangesloten woningen. Dit doet geen beroep op het ada ptief 
vermogen. Op langere termijn als er mogelijkheden ontstaan voor goedkopere 
grootschalige isolatie bijv oorbeeld  bij renovatie en gebiedsontwikkeling, is een lagere 
watertemperatuur te overwegen.  Daardoor kan men uit meer warmtebronnen kiezen, het 
rendement vergroten en zo de energiekosten verlagen.  
3) Voor de meeste overige huishoudens  past het gebruik van hernieuwbaar gas het beste in 
een laagdrempelige energietransitie zonder hoge transitiedrempels (zie Figuur 13). Het  
 Stratelligence  Een Laagdrempelige Energietransitie 
26 
  
Figuur 13: aanpassingen  bij overstap naar andere systeemoplossing  (groen neutraal, geel -, oranje - -)  
Een Laagdrempelige Energietransitie Stratelligence  
27 
 potentieel is echter voor alsnog onvoldoende om daarop over te stappen. Alternatieven 
voor gas hebben hoge transitiedrempels. Als de woning al geschikt is voor een LT -
warmtesysteem, kan het voor een eindgebruiker zinvol zijn om elektrificering te kiezen, 
maar overstap op een warmte net of van HT - verwarming naar LT -verwarming sluit niet aan  
bij de principes van een laagdrempelige  energietransitie. Het lijkt verstandig in de meeste 
situaties een dergelijke systeemwijziging nog even uit te stellen tot het 2e 
vervangingsmoment.  
Wanneer  men bij het eerstkomende vervangingsmoment toch kiest voor een systeemverandering, 
dat wil zeggen een overstap van gas naar een collectieve warmteoplossing  of volledig elektrische 
verwarming dan zijn de voordelen beperkt en de kosten relatief hoog:  
• Vaak i s een grote investering nodig in isolatie om een LT -warmteoptie te gebruiken (voor 
energielabel C en lager), die zich maar ten dele terugverdient;  
• Er zijn grote investeringen nodig in de nieuwe verwarmingsinstallaties en het 
warmteafgiftesysteem in de woning. De kosten liggen nu waarschijnlijk hoger dan bij een overstap op het tweede vervangingsmoment.  
• Vaak zijn (soms ongewenste) aanpassingen nodig in de woning om de systemen te 
plaatsen.  
• Op dit moment zijn er nog veel onzeker heden over de kosten en de beschikbaarheid van 
nieuwe technieken. Men loopt een significant financieel en overlastrisico, wanneer niet 
voldoende zeker is dat een keuze wordt gemaakt voor het beste langetermijnalternatief.  
• De besparingen in CO
2 per geïnvest eerde euro zijn nu nog beperkt. Het kost tijd om 
bestaande w armtenetten te verduurza men en elektriciteit volledig te vergroenen . Na 2030 
moet dit sterk verbeterd zijn.  
• Een suboptimale keuze met als gevolg opnieuw aanpassing bij een vervangingsmoment 
na 2030 is kostbaar. De eerder gemaakte aanpassingen moeten weer ongedaan worden 
gemaakt en er zijn  opnieuw  investeringen  in de woning nodig  (zie Figuur 13). Dit wil je 
voorkomen. Je kunt een euro immers maar een keer uitgeven. Dan is het belangrijk de 
juiste investering en te doen. Dat wil zeggen gerichte pilots in nieuwe technieken en 
grootschalige uitrol van bewezen technieken.  
5.2 REDUCTIE GASGEBRUIK DOOR HYBRIDE OPLOSSING  
Als alles echter bij hetzelfde blijft voor de gasgestookte woningen kunnen de CO 2-doelen in 20 30 
waarschijnlijk niet worden  gerealiseerd . We kunnen d it probleem echter ook  relatief laagdrempelig 
oppakken. 
• Door te stimuleren dat huishoudens met een grotere energievraag bij een volgend vervangingsmoment een hybride oplossing overwegen. Een combinatie van een kleinere warmtepomp en cv -ketel vraagt minder gas, niet per se aanvu llende isolatie en een 
beperkte meerinvestering in de verwarmingsapparatuur. Voor grotere gebruikers vertaalt de meerinvestering zich in lagere energiekosten. Hoe hoger het gasverbruik nu, hoe groter de winst. (Rendabele) isolatie kan het voordeel nog verg roten.  Voor kleine gebruikers van Stratelligence  Een Laagdrempelige Energietransitie 
28 
 gas is de besparing op de variabele energiekosten onvoldoende om de meerkosten van 
de investering te compenseren.18  
• Door de uitbreiding van de volumes groen gas en waterstof te stimuleren en te zorgen dat het gebruikte gas steeds duurzamer wordt. Bij groen gas gaat het vooral om vergisting en 
vergassing van natte reststromen zodat geen conflict ontstaat met landgebruik voor natuur en voedselproductie. Voor groene waterstof gaat het om het verzekeren van voldoen de 
groene stroom en het opbouwen van productiecapaciteit. Significante volumes worden niet voor 2030 verwacht.  
(Tijdelijke) keuze voor een hybride oplossing past in een no -regret -ontwikkelpad. Bij een volgend 
vervangingsmoment kan men alsnog overgaan op al l electric , een warmtenet of bij hernieuwbaar 
gas blijven. Na 2030 is er meer zicht op de haalbaarheid en het rendement van nieuwe technologieën . Uitstel van een systeemverandering  levert voor een woningeigenaar weinig 
financieel risico op. Als de nieuwe i nstallatie afgeschreven is, zijn de kosten van een overstap naar 
een andere energiedrager juist lager door innovatie en de schaalvergroting van inmiddels bewezen technieken.   
De keuze voor een hybride oplossing levert ook bij het gebruik van aardgas in de cv-ketel toch al 
een besparing op de CO
2-uitstoot en het energiegebruik op . De bijdrage van de warmtepomp heeft 
immers een hoger energetisch rendement en een lagere CO 2-uitstoot.  Omdat de ze keuze nauwelijks 
aanpassingen of extra kosten  met zich meebrengt t en opzichte van de huidige situatie, is het geen 
lock-in19, terwijl een overstap naar een warmtenet of LT -warmtesysteem wel feitelijk een lock -in 
betekent .  
Combinatie van alle mogelijkheden die passen binnen een laagdrempelige  energietransitie zou de 
klimaatdoelen kunnen realiseren  zonder dat een (te) groot beroep gedaan wordt op het adaptief 
vermogen. Een dergelijke transitie kan relatief  soepel verlopen doordat weinig aanpassingen nodig 
zijn en aanpassingen die wel gewenst zijn, voordeel opleveren.  Dat realisatie van de klimaatdoelen  
haalbaar  is, werken  we uit in het volgende hoofdstuk.  
 
18 Voor het omslagpunt tussen grotere en kleinere gebruikers zie paragraaf 6.1 . 
19 Een oplossingsrichting die  moeilijk en duur  is om terug te dra aien, waardoor een keuze die in dit geval 
voor 15 jaar wordt gemaakt (de levensduur van installatie) een langetermijnkeuze wordt .  
 
29 
 HOOFDSTUK 6    LAAGDREMPELIGE  ENERGIETRANSITIE :  
EEN TWEE FASENSTRATEGIE  
Het hanteren van principes  voor een laagdrempelige  energietransit ie is goed om eventuele 
weerstand in de samenleving als gevolg van een geforceerde afstap van gas te beperken , maar 
moet wel realiseerbaar zijn en de klimaatdoelen bereik baar maken . In dit hoofdstuk bepalen we 
daarom het ontwikkelpad passend bij deze aanpak , de verwachte kosten en effecten en het beleid 
dat nodig is om het ontwikkelpad uit te voeren.  
Belangrijk punt is dat tot 2050 per huishouden nog tweemaal een aanpassing in de 
verwarmingsinstallatie wordt gedaan. Dit geeft de ruimte voor een tweefasenstrateg ie. Met een 
slimme (wijk) aanpak kan men risicovolle keuzes zo veel mogelijk voorkomen, liggen naar 
verwachting de maatschappelijke kosten lager  en is de CO 2-reduc tie hoger  dan nodig om het 
klimaatdoel voor 2030 in de gebouwde omgeving te halen.  
6.1 FASE 1: NO-REGRET -KEUZES  
In de eerste fase richten het beleid en de wijkaanpak zich op keuzes die al op korte termijn 
kosteneffectief  zijn en weinig beroep doen op het adaptief v ermogen. Daarnaast wordt in fase 1 
de tweede fase voorbereid . Het ontwikkelpad houdt rekening met keuzevrijheid en 
kosteneffectiviteit  om de transitie drempels zo laag mogelijk te houd en. 
Principe van  keuzevrijheid in  wijkaanpak  
Waarom? Onvrijwillige overstap per wijk naar een andere warmteoplossing  veroorzaakt  
weerstand en leidt niet tot een optimale oplossing voor alle huishoudens , zeker als de overstap  
tegelijkertijd isolatie, aanpassing van de infrastructuur en een verandering van de warmte -installatie 
in huis vereist.  Zowel het overstapmoment als de oplossing zullen dan voor veel partijen niet 
optimaal zijn.  
Oplossingen die wel een koppeling van isolatie , infrastructuur en warmte -installatie vragen , passen  
alleen binnen een laagdrempe lige energietransitie als de keuzes  logischerwijs al tegelijk 
plaatsvinden  of de woningen dezelfde optimale oplossing hebben en een klein aantal beslissers 
betrokken is:  
• Bij nieuwbouw  is de isolatie al op het niveau van label A of hoger . Gas is uitgesloten en 
de aanleg van een warmtenet of een passend  elektric iteitsnetwerk  gebeurt  in samenhang 
met de verwarmingsoptie.  
• De aanleg van een nieuw warmtenet of verwarmings alternatief in een homogene wijk met 
veel woningen van een corporatie of enkele vastgoedeigenaren vraagt overleg met een 
beperkt  aantal  partijen . Vaak is al sprake van een  ideaal overstapmoment , nl. bij gepland  
groot onderhoud of renovatie.   Stratelligence  Een Laagdrempelige Energietransitie 
30 
 Overige keuzes die passen  in een laagdrempelige energietransitie vragen geen tot nauwel ijks 
coördinatie van isolatie, infrastructuur en warmte -installatie.  
• Het verduurzamen van bestaande warmtenetten zonder de watertemperatuur aan te 
passen , vraagt enkel afstemming met de warmteleverancier.  
• Vrijwillige k euze voor een warmtepomp voor goe d geïsoleerde woningen , voor een 
hybride oplossing  en voor isolatie die zichzelf terugverdient , vraagt geen coördinatie  
binnen de wijk of een aanpassing van de infrastructuur.  
Onderscheid in een  wijkaanpak voor homogene en voor  heterogene wijken  
Waarom? Voor homogene wijken qua eigen dom, isolati eniveau en woningtype is het mogelijk om 
een oplossing te kiezen  die optimaal is voor het merendeel van de woningen . Eventuele compen -
satie voor woonkostenneutraliteit is dan beperkt.  In heterogene wijken zal de oplossing en het 
vervangingsmoment nooit voor iedereen goed passen. Een warmtenet  is zo een kansrijke oplossing 
voor wijken met een groot deel gelijksoortige corporatiewoningen (bijvoorbeeld jaren 50 en 60 
wijken met veel meer gezins woningen ), maar sluit nie t goed aan bij het adaptief vermogen in een 
ruim opgezette wijk met veel koopwoningen  verdeeld over vooroorlogse  vrijstaande villa’s, 
nieuwbouw appartementen en blokken jaren 8 0 woningen  met een tuintje. Voor een dergelijke wijk 
liggen  verschillende individuele  oplossingen meer voor de hand : elektrische verwarming voor de 
nieuwbouw en hybride oplossingen  of 100% hernieuwbaar  gas voor de overige woningen. Alleen 
dan sluit de verwarmingsopl ossing goed aan bij de woning en kan de eigenaar autonoom keuzes 
maken. Mogelijk v oordeel van een heterogene oplossing is dat geen of beperktere v erzwaring van 
het elektriciteitsnet nodig is . 
Focus  in fase 1 op kosteneffectieve oplossingen die weinig risico kennen : de no-regret -keuzes  
Waarom? Er is nog v oldoende tijd tot 2050, mits de  CO 2-reductie in 2030 voldoende is. En het is 
belangrijk om successen te kunnen laten zien. Keuzes die achteraf ongelukkig uitpakken , zorgen 
ervoor dat de verdere uitrol van de energietransitie vastloopt.  
Kosteneffectieve k euzes met weinig risico zijn:   
• Het verduurzamen van bestaande warmtenetten op locaties waar be schikbar e 
warmtebronnen ook op de lange termijn de meest logische warmtebron zijn (restwarmte, 
biomassa). Wellicht dat op afzienbare termijn bij goede ervaringen m et de proefprojecten 
ook nieuwe bronnen zoals  geothermie of aquathermie  voor deze verduurzaming mogelijk 
zijn. 
• Het kiezen voor elektrische verwarming bij nieuwbouw. Wanneer meer ervaring ontstaat met LT -warmtenetten, komen warmtenetten in beeld bij  dichter e bebouw ing, maar 
voorlopig is het verstandig de resultaten van pilots af te wachten . 
• Het overstappen van 100% gas naar het gebruik van hybride oplossingen  voor grotere 
gebruikers. Dit bespaart op het gasgebruik  en vraagt geen aanpassingen of hoge 
investeringen . Hybride oplossingen zijn voor de meeste koopwoningen  en veel 
huurwoningen in fase 1 het meest aantrekkel ijk. Vanaf een gasverbruik van 5 00 tot 1000 
m
3 wegen de hogere vaste kosten op tegen de besparingen op het energieverbruik  (zie 
Kader 4). Dit betekent dat voor de meeste woningen een hybride oplossing  kosten 
bespaart. Voor corporaties  en woningen die nu al collectief verwarmd worden , kan een 
warmtenet voordeliger zijn  en voor kleine gebruikers een cv -ketel. Bij de volgende  Een Laagdrempelige Energietransitie Stratelligence  
31 
 vervanging laat een hybride oplossing  nog alle opties open . Er is geen sprake van lock -in. 
De alternatieve opties zijn in de tussentijd waarschijnlijk goedkoper  geworden en men  
heeft kunnen experimenteren  met de verhouding tussen inzet van de warmtepomp en de 
ketel. Hierdoor is duidelijk  of en onder welke voorwaarden overstap naar 100% elektrisch 
aantrekkelijk is.   
Kader 4:  omslagpunt waarop hybride oplossing kosteneffectiever  is dan enkel een  hr-ketel  
Een hybride oplossing vraagt een grotere investering dan een reguliere ketel. De variabele energiekosten  liggen echter 
lager, doordat een warmte pomp zeer efficiënt  een deel van de energievraag levert. Het omslagpunt voor 
eindgebruikers  waarop een hybride oplossing voordeliger is dan een reguliere  ketel ligt voor veel situaties tussen de 
500 en 1000 m3 aardgasgebruik. Het omslagpunt  hangt echter sterk af van de (ontwikkeling van de) prijzen van 
elektriciteit en gas, de energiebelastingen, de rente, de reducties in investeringskosten  en het rendement van de 
warmtepomp en het aandeel gas in het energieverbruik van de hybride oplossing. De gebruikte aannames in de 
baseline berekening en de gevoeligheid  ten opzichte van  deze 100% -waarden staan hieronder . De gevoeligheid voor 
rente is niet afgebeeld, maar beperkt.

• Individuele huishoudens die een bestaande woning met energielabel A hebben en 
duurzaamheid belangrijk vinden , kunnen op eigen initiatief veilig overstappen op een 
warmtepomp. Energielabel A is voldoende voor het gebruik met een warmtepomp en als 
het om enkele woningen  per wijk gaat, is verzwaring van het net niet nodig . Deze 
huishoudens kunnen als early adopters  een voorbeeldfunctie  vervullen.  Een warmtepomp 
is vooral gunstig bij een hoog energiegebruik. Besparingen op de variabele kosten 
compenseren dan d e hogere vaste kosten . Een hoog energiegebruik verwacht je echter 
niet direct  bij goede isolatie.  
• Aanleg van nieuw e warmtenetten kan aantrekkelijk zijn voor homogene wijken met veel 
corporatiewon ingen en utiliteit , waar restwarmte  of andere geschikte duurzame 
warmtebronnen beschikbaar zijn. Nieuwe netten moeten  waarschijnlijk direct duurzame  
warmte leveren . Uitbreidin g kan aantrekkelijk zijn als er al een warmtenet ligt en tegen 
relatief  lage kosten extra aansluitingen  gemaakt k unnen  worden.  Voor corporaties  liggen 
de kosten van een warmtenet volgens PBL (PBL, april 2019)  gunstiger dan de kosten van  
bijvoorbeeld warmtepompen. Afhankelijk van de kostenreducties en het gasgebruik kan een hybride warmtepomp voor corporaties concurreren met een warmtenet. Voor 
koopwoningen is een warmtenet gemiddeld ongunstiger.

 Voorbereiding v an de definitieve opties voor fase 2  
Waarom? Bij het tweede vervangingsmoment moeten voor alle woningen en wijken betaalbare en 
betrouwbare CO 2-neutrale  oplossingen beschikbaar zijn. Zo niet dan zijn er alsnog geforceerde 
dure keuzes nodig in fase 2 bij woningen die niet goed geïsoleerd  kunnen worden en waar geen 
andere HT -verwarmingsoptie dan gas beschikbaar is.  Voorbereiding  is nodig op de volgende 
gebieden : 
• Er is behoefte aan goedkopere mogelijkheden voor isolatie en verbetering van bestaande 
isolatie ( bijv. spouwmuurisolatie vervangen).  
• Meer ervaring met LT -warmtebronnen is nodig als alternatief  voor goed geïsoleerde 
woningen en om het rendement  van HT-warmtenetten te verbeteren . 
• De kosten en risico’s van andere HT -warmtebronnen zoals (diepe) geothermie moeten 
worden verminderd.  
• De beschikbaarheid van hernieuwbaar gas moet worden uitgebreid door de productie 
van groen gas en groene waterstof te stimuleren.  
Dit resulteert in het ontwikkelpad voor de laagdrempelige energietransitie ( Figuur 14).

 6.2 FASE 2: DEFINITIEVE KEUZES  
Voor w oning en die in fase 2 nog gas gebruiken  (cv-ketel of hybride oplossing ), kan een verdere 
aanpassing nodig zijn in geval het aanbod hernieuwbaar gas  tekortschiet . Er is echter  een goede  
kans dat de hoeveelheid hernieuwbaar  gas toereikend  is, zo blijkt hieronder. In dat geval kan de 
transitie zo go ed als vanzelf plaatsvinden.  
• Volgens de aannames in de Startanalyse is er voor de gebouwde omgeving op termijn 
2,0 miljard  m3 groen gas beschikbaar. De Green Liaisons studie (De Gemeynt, april 2018)  
voorziet echter in totaal de beschikbaarheid van 13,2 miljard  m3 groen gas in 2050 (419 
PJ). Hoeveel hiervan voor woningen beschikbaar komt, is onzeker.   
• Uitgaande van autonome isolatie naar minimaal label C ( spijtvrije isolatie ), kan 18% 
worden bespaard op het gebruik van hernieuwbaar  gas. Verbetering van het rendement 
van de warmtepomp en het rendement van de ketel door technische ontwikkeling 
verminde ren het gasgebruik  verder .  
• Tussen 2030 en 2050 verwachten de Nederlandse industrie en kennisinstellingen dat er 
betaalbare  waterstof in Nederland kan worden geproduceerd en geïmporteerd  
(Kalavasta, juni 2019)  (TKI Nieuw Gas, maart 2018) . De gemiddelde kostprijs tussen 
2030 en 2050 ligt op basis van een inventarisatie v an verschillende  studies (H2GO, 
december 2019)  rond de 2 €/kg, met een gemiddelde bandbreedte van ca. € 1,5 tot 
2,5 per kg.20 Het kostenverschil tussen groene waterstof en aardgas is op termijn te 
overbruggen door de energiebelasting afhankelijk te maken van de CO 2-uitstoot.21 Voor 
de eindgebruiker is een eenzelfde hoeveelheid energie in de vorm van waterstof dan even duur als in de  vorm van aardgas.  
En wat als er uiteindelijk toch onvoldoende hernieuwbaar gas beschikbaar is ? Loopt de twee -
fasenstrategie dan vast? Nee, er  zijn dan nog steeds oplossingen beschikbaar, de bestaande 
alternatieven en waarschijnlijk nieuwe nu nog onbekend e alternatieven . En dan veroorzaken de 
bestaande alternatieven lagere transitiedrempels dan nu : 
• Aanvullende isolatie zodat een warmtepomp of LT -warmtenet mogelijk is . Deze overstap 
gaat niet zonder transitiedrempels , maar in fase 2 zal de overstap voordeli ger zijn dan in 
fase 1 en minder risico’s kennen. Tegen die tijd zal duidelijk zijn welk isolatieniveau 
minimaal vereist is voor gebruik van LT -verwarming: B+ of hoger. Verschillende nieuwe L T-
technieken zullen volwassen zijn . 
• Een overstap naar een HT -warm tenet op geothermie of een andere warmtebron. Ook d eze 
overstap gaat niet vanzelf , maar in fase 2 liggen de k osten lager  dan in fase 1 en zijn er 
minder risico’s.

2018)  en € 1,30 in 2050 (DNV GL, 2019)  voor kostprijzen waterstof uit elektrolyse.  
21 Geschatte meerkosten groene waterstof op basis van eigen (conse rvatievere) inschatting waterstofprijzen 
(in 2030 € 3,77 en in 2050 € 2,60 zie bijlage) dalen van 5 4 ct. (2030) naar 23  ct. (2050) per m3 aardgas 
(aardgas à € 45,6 ct. per m3) bij dezelfde energie- inhoud . De waarde van de vermeden CO 2 per m3 aardgas 
bedraagt in 2050 € 0,29 per m3 aardgas. De huidige energiebelasting op aardgas bedraagt ongeveer 35 
ct. per m3. Stratelligence  Een Laagdrempelige Energietransitie

 6.3 EFFECTEN  VAN DE LAAGDREMPELIGE  ENERGIETRANSITIE  
Het ontwikkelpad van de laagdrempelige  energietransitie is alleen acceptabel  als het tussendoel 
uit het Klimaatakkoord voor 2030 wordt gerealiseerd. Dat betekent dat de strategie in 2030 
minimaal 3,4 Mton CO 2-uitstoot moet bespa ren bovenop de besparing doo r vervangende 
nieuwbouw . Gasloze nieuwbouw is al onderdeel van de referentie. Aangenomen is dat het 
energiegebruik van nieuwbouwwoningen volledig CO 2-neutraal is.22  
Deze besparing is naar verwachting te realiseren met een combinatie van warmtenetten, rend abele 
isolatie en hybride oplossingen (zie Tabel 7). In deze paragraaf  laten we zien hoeveel gasgestookte 
woningen  in de tweefasenstrategie minimaal moeten overgaan van een reguliere cv -ketel naar een 
hybride oplossing om dit tussendoel te bereiken . Daarnaast bepalen we de CO 2-reductie voor  een 
potentieel scenario met een hoger aandeel hybride oplossingen.

Warmtenetten  
Zo’n 5% van de woningen heeft een aansluiting op de stadsverwarming. Het aandeel warmtenetten zal stijgen.  De uitbreiding van de warmtenetten schatten we iets lager in dan in het streefbeeld van 
het ontwerp klimaatakkoord PBL  (PBL, april 2019) . Tot 2030 nemen we de uitbreiding  met 0,2 
miljoen  huurwoningen hiervan over en niet het v eronderstelde aantal koopwoningen . Dit is omdat 
voor koopwoningen een warmten et een hogere  onrendabele top heeft dan de alternatieven volgens 
de analyse van PBL  en een overstap  minder goed scoort qua beroep op het adaptief vermogen . 
Deze aanname betekent dat met warmtenetten voor koopwoningen –  in lijn met het Klimaatakkoord 
– een extra potentieel voor CO
2-reductie mogelijk is. Het maximumaantal  aansluitingen  in 2050

toegerekend  in plaats van de gebouwde omgeving . Een Laagdrempelige Energietransitie Stratelligence  
35 
 hebben we g ezet op 1 m iljoen woningen.  Dit is een derde va n het aantal woningen  in (zeer) sterk 
stedelijke gemeenten . Buiten de stedelijke gebieden  zijn de netwerkkosten van een warmtenet vaak 
te hoog om de oplossing financieel  aantrekkelijk te maken. Ongeveer 30% va n alle woningen is  in 
handen van corporaties. Voor deze woningen is een warmten et een aantrekkelijk alternatief. Het 
te realiseren  aantal aansluitingen  is echter onzeker en afhankelijk van vele factoren.   
Voor het berekenen van het (indirecte) gasgebruik d at past bij de woningaantallen en 
verwarmingsopties nemen we aan dat in 2030 50% CO 2-reductie kan worden gerealiseerd  bij de 
bestaande warmtenetten door  verduurzam ing van de warmtebron en nieuwe warmtenetten direct 
duurzaam zijn met uitzondering van het gasverbruik voor piekmomenten en back -up.23 Geleidelijke 
verbetering van de woningen naar energielabel C zorgt voor aanvullende reductie van het fossiele 
aardgasgebruik.  We nemen in onze berekening aan dat een derde van alle woningen met  nu nog 
een energielabel D of lager in 2030 minimaal een energi elabel C heeft.  Isolatie tot energielabel C 
is nu al rendabel.

 Hybride oplossing  
Bestaande woningen waarvoor een warmtenet niet de meest voor de hand liggende oplossing is, 
zijn in fase 1 vanuit het perspectief van het adaptief vermogen het meest gebaat bij het gebruik van gas. Kiezen voor een hybride oplossing bespaart flink op het aardgasgebruik en de bijbehorende CO
2-uitstoot (aanname gemiddeld 65% reductie25). Isolatie van de woning tot 
energielabel C past ook in de strategie.  
Het omslagpunt waarop een hybride oplossing interessanter is dan een gewone cv -ketel ligt bij de 
huidige g asprijs (incl. belastingen, btw) tussen de 500 en 1000 m3. Het gemiddelde gasverbruik 
per huishouden ligt tussen de 1250 en 1300 m3 en voor koopwoningen tussen de 1450 en  
1500 m3. Voor veel huishoudens die hun gasketel willen vervangen, is het daarom fina ncieel 
aantrekkelijk om een hybride oplossing te kiezen. De beschikbare subsidie en de stijgende 
gasprijzen maken deze keuze nog aantrekkelijker.  
Voor corporaties/verhuurders liggen de besparingen lager omdat deze niet volledig via een hogere 
huur kunnen worden terugverdiend. Voor het bepalen van het minimum scenario om het klimaatdoel te halen, kijken we daarom naar de koopwoningen (≈  60% woningen is koopwoning). Ook laten 
we het effect bij een hoger aandeel hybride oplossingen zien, nl. bij overstap van 75% van alle 
woningen (koop en huur) (zie Tabel 7 en Tabel 8).  
Uit de analyse volgt dat minimaal 24% van de nu gasgestookte koopwoningen zou moeten kiezen 
voor een hybride oplossing om in 2030 een totale CO
2-reductie van 3,4 Mton te halen. We 
verwachten dat dit haalbaar is. Het is zelfs mogelijk meer op de CO 2-uitstoot te besparen.  
Gemiddeld twee op de drie woningen krijgen de komende 10 jaar met een vervangingsvraag te 
maken. Dit betekent dat ongeveer een op de drie koop woningen dan voor een hybride 
warmtepomp moet kiezen. Dit is een laag percentage in vergelijking met het omslagpunt waarop 
een hybride oplossing voor de eigenaar kosteneffectief is.  
De CO 2-reductie kan nog hoger uitvallen. Stel dat 75% van alle huishoudens overstapt, dan levert 
dat een totale besparing van 6,8 Mton in 2030 op. Huishoudens die kiezen voor hybride hebben 
waarschijnlijk een hoger gasgebruik dan gemiddeld. Dit vergroot de CO 2-reductie. En indien een 
deel van het gas bestaat uit hernieuwbaar gas, dan neemt de besparing verder  toe.  
 
25 Inschattingen diverse bronnen variëren tussen 50% en 75%. Aandeel is afhankelijk van iso latienive au 
woning en verhouding tussen energiegebruik voor ruimteverwarming en warm water.  Een Laagdrempelige Energietransitie Stratelligence

Figuur 15:  indicatief verloop CO 2-reductie laagdrempelige energietransitie ; na 2030 wordt aardgas geleidelijk 
vervangen door hernieuwbaar gas  
De beschikbare volumes groen gas en waterstof kunnen de resterende gasvraag nu nog niet 
voorzien. In 2050 is echter de vraag naar verwachting sterk gedaald door de inzet van hybride oplossingen , warmtenetten, bestaande en nieuwe technieken, spijtvrije isolatie en vervanging van 
woningen door nieuwbouw . In de getoonde scenario’s  is voor de woningen in de gebouwde 
omgeving 3, 1 tot 5,7 miljard m
3 hernieuwbaar gas nodig (zie  Tabel 8 en Figuur 15). Als de 
hoeveelheid groen gas voor de gebouwde omgeving dan niet uitstijgt boven  de 2 miljard m3 die 
nu wordt  ingeschat , is er nog een tekort van  1,1 tot 3,7 miljard m3 aardgas , ofwel zo’n 35  tot  
115 PJ. 
Om deze energievraag via waterstof in te vullen , is 4 tot 12 GW wind op zee nodig. Dit zou  ook 
zonder import kunnen passen binnen het maximum potentieel van 40 tot 80 GW (PBL, oktober 
2017) .  
Kosten laagdrempelige energietransitie ten opzichte van streefbeeld  
In het streefbeeld uit het ontwerpklimaatakkoord (PBL, april 2019)  voorziet men  een verdeling van 
50% warmtenet, 25% hybride en 25% all electric  bij het ‘van gas los’ halen van 1,5 miljoen 
woningen . De maatschappelijke kosten van de  laagdrempelige  energietran sitie ten opzichte van 
dit streefbeeld zijn  gunstig :  
• Voor nieuwbouw verschilt  het beleid niet en zijn de  kosten gelijk . 
• De verduurzaming van de huidige warmtenetten is onderdeel van het  streefbeeld en maakt 
geen verschil . 
• Er worden minder warmtenetten uitgerold, met name voor ruimer opgezette wijken met koopwoningen in stedelijke gebieden. Dit heeft waarschijnlijk een gunstig effect op de kosten omdat de alternatieven een kleinere onrend abele top hebben dan een warmtenet.  
• Gemiddeld zijn er meer woningen waarbij het verwarmingssysteem voor 2030 wordt 
aangepast dan in het streefbeeld . Het break -even punt (in nationale kosten ) op basis van  
de gemiddelde investeringskosten 2020 -2030 en verwachte gas- en elektriciteitsprijzen in 
2030 ligt bij een gasverbruik tussen de 70 0 en 11 00 m
3 gas. Een overstap is dus voor de 
meeste woningen  maatschappelijk rendabel. Voor eindgebruikers ligt het omslagpunt door 
Stratelligence  Een Laagdrempelige Energietransitie

 btw en  energiebelastingen lager, ook zonder ISDE -subsidie. Er lijkt weinig financiële  
stimulans  nodig te zijn  om eigenaren over de streep te halen.  
• Voor de aanleg van warmte pompen in bestaande woningen  en warmtenetten zijn wel 
subsidies nodig  om de onrendabele top te compenseren. V oor een warmtepomp is goede 
maar dure isolatie noodzakelijk . De kosten hiervoor vervallen in de laagdrempelige 
energietransit ie.  
• Investeringen in het elektriciteitsnet nodig bij all electric  oplossingen worden beperkt. Deze 
investeringen zijn in de vergelijking nog niet zijn meegenomen.  
De laagdrempelige  energietransitie biedt in principe een betaalbare, duurzame en betrouwbare 
energievoorziening zonder geforceerde keuzes voor iedereen, onafhankelijk van isolat iegraad van 
de woning, de regio en de woonomgeving (stad of platteland). Deze strategie veroorzaakt geen 
groeiende ongelijkheid en kent vooral voordelen (zie  Tabel 9).

6.4 CONCLUSIES EN AANBEVELINGEN VOOR  DE LAAGDREMPELIGE  
ENERGIETRANSITIE  
Om een laagdrempelige  energietransitie voor de samenleving mogelijk te maken, is ondersteuning 
door de overheid noodzakelijk. Geadviseerd wordt dat h et Rijk de principes van de 
laagdrempelige  energietra nsitie uitdraagt  en implement eert en dat de wijkaanpak wordt  aangepast 
(zie Tabel 10). Daarnaast wordt aanbevolen  de opties voor fase 2 uit  te breiden en te faciliteren , 
o.a. door de productie van hernieuwbaar gas te stimuleren.   
Pilots om onzekerheden en risico’s weg te nemen  
In fase 1 zijn onderzoek naar en pilots met nieuwe technieken nodig om ervaring op te doen en 
de risico’s te verkleinen. Regelmatige evaluatie van de  beschikbare alternatieven voor aardgas en 
voor besparingsmogelijkheden  is gewenst . Geadviseerd wordt p ilots met nieuwe veelbelovende 
technieken te (blijven) facilit eren en de kosten van deze pilots te socialiseren . 
Opschaling productie her nieuwbaar gas en groene stroom  
Op landelijke schaal is het belangrijk dat er zoveel mogelijk hernieuwbaar gas beschikbaar komt. 
Voor de periode tot 2030 is dit niet cruciaal en zijn de kosten van het aanbod nog hoog, maar na 
2030 kan steeds minder  gebruik worden gemaakt van aardgas en moet er meer hernieuwbaar gas 
(groen gas en waterstof) komen . Voorbereiding van deze nationale opschaling van de groengas - 
en waterstofproductie is dan ook gewenst. Daar voor moet het aanbod van groene stroom snel(ler) 
worden u itgebreid.  
Landelijke coördinatie  
De aardgascampagne werd destijds uitgerold door een organisatie die daarmee was belast . Ook 
de levering van waterstof  heeft een dergelijke organisatie en principes nodig. Nu zijn provincies, 
gemeenten en industriële clust ers de trekkers, maar er is nog niet gezorgd voor een organisatie die 
alles bij elkaar brengt en er een landelijk dekkend systeem van kan maken. Dit zou wel verstandig 
zijn. Het is g oed als het Rijk de regie voert –  net a ls in de jaren 60  - op een transiti e- en 
ombouwplan .  
Stimuleren vrijwillige toepassing maatschappelijk rendabele isolatie en hybride oplossingen  
Voor de huishoudens met een hoog aardgasgebruik levert een hybride oplossing met cv -ketel al 
snel een maatschappelijk en individueel voordeel op zelfs wanneer er nog geen hernieuwbaar gas 
door het gasnet stroomt. Isolatiemaatregelen zijn eerder rendabel voor gebruikers met een relatief hoge warmtevraag. Aanbevolen wordt de informatievoorziening hierop aan  te passen: slim CO

 uitstoot ve rminderen in plaats van geforceerd van (aard)gas los. Afsluiting van het aardgasnet is 
de komende jaren dan  in veel wijken niet aan de orde.  
Geleidelijke overstap hernieuwbaar gas  
In de markt voor de gebouwde omgeving bestaat fiscale ruimte om het kostenve rschil tussen 
hernieuwbaar gas en aardgas te overbruggen. Daarmee kan hernieuwbaar gas al in fase 1 een 
aantrekkelijk alternatief worden met een hoge sociale acceptatie. Door de meerkosten van hernieuwbaar gas te socialiseren, ontstaat solidariteit door de  tijd heen en een gegarandeerde 
afzet voor de eerste producenten van hernieuwbaar gas. De CO
2-reductie valt hierdoor hoger uit.

van nieuwe technieken in homogene 
wijken/buurten.  
6.5 DE WIJKAANPAK  BIJ DE LAAGDREMPELIGE  ENERGIETRANSITIE  
De laagdrempelige  energietransitie heeft invloed op de uitvoering van de wijkaanpak . Nu zijn het 
instrumentarium en de plannen vooral  gefocust op de korte termijn en op één alternatief per wijk, 
waardoor suboptimale keuzes mogelijk zijn. Onze aanpak  richt zich op de korte en lange termijn 
en laat de keuze voor één alternatief per wijk los.  
Fase 1: focus op keuzevrijheid en kosteneffectieve oplossingen  
Voor fase 1 is de volgende invulling van de  wijkaanpak gewenst : 
• Nieuwbouwwijken.  Voor nieuwbouw is geen gasaansluiting meer verplicht en alleen in 
uitzonderingen toegestaan. Elektrische verwarming of aansluiting op een LT -warmtenet ligt 
dan voor de hand. Aansluiting op een HT -warmtenet is over het algemeen duurder dan op 
een LT -warmten et. Een warmtepomp past beter bij grondgebonden koopwoningen en een 
kleinschalig LT -warmtenet beter bij meergezins - en huurwoninge n. Op dit moment zijn veel 
lagetemperatuurtechnieken nog niet uitontwikkeld. Op langere termijn zullen LT-
warmtenetten naar verwachting  meer in beeld komen. Regelmatig dient te worden Een Laagdrempelige Energietransitie Stratelligence  
41 
 geëvalueerd  of ontwikkelingen in nieuwe technieken (aqua - en zonthermie) deze lokaal 
aantrekkelijker maken.  
• Wijken met een warmtenet.  Het verduurzamen van de bestaande HT -warmtenetten vraagt 
weinig van het  adaptief vermogen. B estaande warmtenetten moet en overstappen op 
betaalbare, betrouwbare en duurzame bronnen, zodat het energiegebruik van 
aangesloten woningen automatisch vergroent . Dit levert geen spijt op, mits de alternatieve 
warmtebron vergelij kbare of lagere kosten heeft. Het optimale verduur zamings moment 
hangt af van de gemiddelde jaarkosten van de duurzame warmtebron. Wanneer restwarmte of gebruik van biomassa het voor de hand liggende alternatief is, ook op termijn, is overstap in fase 1 gew enst. Wanneer verduurzaming via geothermie mogelijk 
lijkt, is het in het algemeen verstandig nog even af te wachten totdat de techniek zich bewezen heeft. Investeren in isolatie tot label C kan aantrekkelijk zijn.  
• Homogene wijken  met een hoge bebouwingsdi chtheid, een vergelijkbaar isolatieniveau 
die voor  een groot deel in eigendom van corporaties zijn of utiliteit betref fen. Voor deze 
wijken kan een collectieve warmteoplossing  de meest aantrekkelijke optie zijn, zeker 
wanneer er een meekoppelkans is met rioolvervanging of grootschalige renovatie. Belangrijk is dat een HT - of LT -warmtenet (en dus een systeemverandering) alleen 
plaatsvindt als er zekerheid is over de langetermijn beschikbaarheid  van bronnen, dit 
alternatief als  collectieve oplossing brede steun geniet en kosteneffectiever  is dan de 
alternatieven.  Als een warmtepomp of hybride oplossing het beste alternatief blijkt te zijn, 
kunnen met de wijkaanpak schaal voordelen w orden gerealiseerd  bij gelijktijdige inkoop  
en installatie . Ondersteuning van spijtvrije isolatie kan onderdeel van  de wijkaanpak zijn.  
In dit geval verschilt de aanpak niet van die van heterogene wijken.  
• Heterogene wijken . In heterogene wijken qua eigendo m en isolatieniveau ondersteunt de 
wijkaanpak  een vrijwillige overstap naar warmtepomp of hybride oplossing  en isolatie. In 
deze wijken kiest men  in fase 1 niet per wijk  de beste oplossing, maar wordt gestimuleerd 
dat eigenaren individueel  de beste optie kiezen bij het volgende vervangingsmoment van 
de installatie en dat ze isolatiemaatregelen en efficiëntiemaatregelen uitvoeren die zichzelf 
terugverdienen  (dubbel glas, s pouwmuur, inregelen cv etc.) . Voor woonkostenneutraliteit 
zijn dan geen grote subsidiebedragen nodig. De meerwaarde van de wijkaanpak om gezamenlijk de beste oplossing te kiezen , is voor deze wijken kleiner, doordat de 
vervangingsmomenten van installaties en de verschillen tussen de woningen groot zijn. Wel zijn er schaal voordelen mogelijk  als eigenaren gezamenlijk installaties inkopen of isolatie 
laten uitvoeren. Particuliere initiatieven zijn mogelijk  mits betaalbaarheid, betrouwbaar -
heid en duurzaamheid gewaarborgd zijn. Ook is het nuttig om  proeven door bewoners te 
stimuleren die laten zien  of de bestaande warmtevoorziening efficiënter kan. Bijvoorbeeld 
door de watertemperatuur lager in te stellen (of alleen in voor-  en najaar) en te beoordelen 
welke won ingen nu al in aanmerking komen voor verwarmingsalternatieven die met een 
lage of middentemperatuur werken.  In deze wijken wordt het gasnet niet weg gehaald  
tenzij  deze niet meer nodig is.  
Fase 2: vervolgstappen afhankelijk van ontwikkelingen  
Voor f ase 2 is de wijkaanpak nog indicatief, maar naar verwachting is het nodig om naast de 
verdere verduurzamingstappen per wijk dan de volgende wijkgerichte acties op te pakken:  Stratelligence  Een Laagdrempelige Energietransitie 
42 
 • In dichtbebouwde wijken waarbij collectieve oplossingen zoals warmtenetten mogelij k en 
aantrekkelijk geworden zijn, deze netten uit te rollen. Dit zijn waarschijnlijk wijken met 
veel meergezins-  en corporatiewoningen waarvoor bijvoorbeeld geothermie of 
aquathermie een goed alternatief is.  
• In wijken met  steeds meer elektrische verwarming  tijdig het elektriciteitsnet te verzwaren 
zodat de piekcapaciteit kan worden opgevangen.  
• In wijken waar veel woningen hernieuwbaar gas nodig blijven hebben het overstapmoment naar waterstof te bepalen in samenwerking met de nationale coördinatie organisatie  als 
blijkt dat meer dan 20% waterstof nodig is om in de totale warmtevraag te voorzien.  
Door deze adaptieve en gefaseerde aanpak mag op minder weerstand in de samenleving worden 
gerekend als gevolg van meer autonomie en keuzevrijheid, lagere kosten en minder overlast en 
gedwongen ingrepen in de woning. Burgers en wijken krijgen de mogelijkheid op het basisalternatief vooruit te lopen. Anderen hoeven weinig te doen, maar kunnen kiezen voor opties die goed zijn voor hun portemonnee. Voor iedereen is er een goede en betaalbare oplossing beschikbaar. De noodzakelijke CO
2-reductie vraagt een kleinere investering en h et 
aardgasverbruik neemt  sneller af. De haalbaarheid van het bereiken van de klimaatdoelen neemt 
zo fors toe . En dat is winst voor iede reen.

gebruik gemaakt van gemiddelde prijzen van warmte uit biomassa (€ 13,9  per GJ) zoals 
bepaald in de TNO -studie (Tigchelaar, et al., 2019)  en restwarmte. Voor restwarmte is in

 6) De kostprijzen van groene waterstof zijn bepaald met de aanname dat vanaf 2030 met 
name energie uit wind op zee wordt gebruikt. De gemiddelde kosten van deze elektriciteit 
in Europa zijn overgenomen uit World Energy Outlook 2019  (IEA, november 2019) , (zie 
Figuur 16).

naar 2050 toegevoegd  
Berekening prijzen waterstof  en benodigd vermogen voor elektriciteitsopwekking t.b.v. waterstof  
De prijs van groene waterstof  hangt sterk af van de elektriciteitsprijs (80%) , zie Tabel 12. 
Aangeno men is dat bij de verdere ontwikkeling van windparken op zee, waterstof gebruikt gaat 
worden om energie aan land te krijgen en op te slaan. Hierdoor kan waterstof in 2030 en 2050 
profiteren van de lagere elektriciteitstarieven van windenergie die het Inter national Energ y Agency 
verwacht voor Europa. De hier berekende waterstofprijs ligt boven de prijzen die in verschillende recente studies wordt geprognosticeerd. De gemiddelde kostprijs tussen 2030 en 2050 ligt op basis van een inventarisatie van verschille nde studies (H2GO, december 2019)  rond de 2 €/kg, 
met een gemiddelde bandbreedte van ca. € 1,5 tot 2,5 per kg.
26 
Per kilogram bevat waterstof ongeveer 3,8 keer zoveel energie als een kubieke meter aardgas 
(120 MJ/31,65 MJ). Een prijs van 46,3 ct. per m3 voor aardgas (KEV 2030 en 2050) is zo 
vergelijkbaar met een prijs van € 1,73 per kg waterstof. In vergelijking met aardgas is waterstof nu nog duurder, maar dit kan dus veranderen.  
Om grote volumes waterstof beschikbaar te maken, zijn voldoende windparken of import van 
waterstof of energiedragers nodig. Voor 100 PJ (833 miljoen kg) aan waterstof wordt bij 50 kWh elektriciteit per kg (efficiëntie in 2050) ruim 41000 GWh gebruikt. Bij 4000 vollasturen voor windparken op zee betekent dat een opgesteld vermogen van 10,4 GW aan wind op zee. Dat is bijna het verwachte opgestelde vermogen op zee in 2030 (10,7 GW). De totale potentie wind op 
zee wordt geschat op 40 -80 GW (PBL, oktober 2017) . Voor 80 GW moeten a ndere functies zoals 
visserij, scheepvaart, natuur, defensie etc. flink inkrimpen.  
  
 
26 O.a. € 2,24 - € 2,92 in 2030 (CE Delft, juni 2018) , € 2,17 -  € 3,01 in 2040 (TNO & DNV GL, november 
2018)  en € 1,30 in 2050 (DNV GL, 2019)  voor kostprijzen waterstof uit elektrolyse.

Introductie maatregelen  
Het Herstel- en Veerkrachtplan (HVP) is een pa kket van 22 hervormingen en 28 investeringen. 
Het plan draagt bij aan de ambities van het kabi net op het gebied van de groene- en digitale 
transitie, en het bevat grootschalige maatregelen op het gebied van woningbouw, de arbeidsmarkt en het Nederlandse belastingstelsel. 
Uitgelichte maatregelen 
 
 
Lijst met alle maatregelen per thema uit het plan 
Bevorderen groene transitie 
Deze maatregelen bevorderen de groene transitie, met directe bijdragen aan de klimaat- en 
energietransitie. Ook andere maatregelen in het plan hebben een positieve impact op het 
klimaat.  
INVESTERINGEN Wind op Zee 
Deze maatregel vergroot de capaciteit voor windenergie op de Noordzee, terwijl negatieve 
eƯecten op natuur en omgeving worden beperkt. Di t gebeurt door investeringen in veiligheid op 
zee, natuurherstel en betere integratie van windenergie op land. 
Groenvermogen waterstof 
De maatregel Groenvermogen waterstof versnelt de ontwikkeling van een duurzaam 
waterstofsysteem in Nederland. Dit gebeurt door investeringen in demonstratieprojecten voor grootschalige elektrolyse, onderzoek naar pr oductie en opslag, en opleidingen om meer 
waterstofspecialisten op te leiden. Zo draagt de  maatregel bij aan een schone en innovatieve 
energievoorziening. 
Energietransitie binnenvaart (project ZES) 
Deze maatregel bevordert elektrisch en emissievrij transport over binnenwateren. Dit gebeurt 
door de inzet van Modular Energy Containers (MEC’s), de aanleg van 8 laadplaatsen en de 
introductie van volledig elektrische binnenvaartschepen.  
Programma Natuur 
Het Programma Natuur richt zich op het herstel van natuur in Nederland door de negatieve 
eƯecten van stikstofuitstoot te verminderen. Dit gebeurt met acties in of rond Natura 2000-
gebieden, zoals het verbeteren van natuurkwaliteit, hydrologische maatregelen en het behoud van natuurgebieden. Het programma ondersteunt provincies met ﬁnanciële middelen voor 
herstelmaatregelen, om zo de instandhoudin g van soorten en habitats te verbeteren. 
Subsidieregeling sanering varkenshouderijen 
Deze maatregel richt zich op het verminderen va n ammoniakemissies en geurhinder in gebieden 
met veel varkenshouderijen en het verlagen va n stikstofdepositie in Natura 2000-gebieden. 
Varkenshouders ontvangen subsidies om vrijwi llig hun bedrijven te beëindigen en hun 
productiecapaciteit te slopen. 
Luchtvaart in transitie 
Deze maatregel richt zich op het verduurzamen van de Nederlandse luchtvaart, met het doel 
klimaatneutraliteit tegen 2050. De investering ondersteunt de ontwikkeling van waterstoftechnologie voor vliegtuigen, waaronder het ontwerp van waterstofmotoren en aandrijfsystemen. Daarnaast wordt er een denktank opgericht om samenwerking tussen 
luchtvaartinstituten en internationale fabrikanten te bevorderen. 
HERVORMINGEN 
Energiewet 
Deze hervorming moderniseert en integreert de regelgeving voor gas- en 
elektriciteitsenergiesystemen door de huidige Gaswet en Elektriciteitswet samen te voegen. De 
wet verbetert de uitwisseling van data en versnelt vergunningen voor energieprojecten. Netbeheerders krijgen duidelijke regels. Eindgebr uikers krijgen meer mogelijkheden om mee te 
doen op de energiemarkt. Ook wordt hun bescherming beter. 
Invoering en aanscherping CO2 he Ưing industrie 
De CO2-he Ưing voor de industrie moet de uitstoot verminderen. Er komt een minimumprijs per 
ton CO2. Zakt de EU-ETS -prijs onder deze grens, dan wordt het verschil als belasting geheven. 
De hervorming regelt de invoer ing en aanscherping van deze he Ưing om extra emissiereductie te 
stimuleren. 
Hervorming energiebelasting 
De hervorming van de energiebelasting stimuleert bedrijven en huishoudens om minder energie 
te verbruiken. Ook moedigt het de overstap naar duurzamere energiebronnen aan. Dit gebeurt door wijzigingen in de belastingtarieven. Aardgas wordt duurder. Elektriciteit wordt goedkoper. 
Daarnaast worden energiebelastingen minder afbouwend. Bepaalde belastingvrijstellingen 
verdwijnen. De belastingverlaging voor elektr iciteitsverbruikers wordt tijdelijk verhoogd. 
Hervorming autobelastingen 
De hervorming van de autobelasting vermindert het aantal kilometers dat wordt gereden met 
auto's op fossiele brandsto Ưen. Dit gebeurt op twee manieren. De btw-vrijstelling in de belasting 
van personenauto’s en motorrijwielen (BPM) voor fossiele bestelauto’s van commerciële exploitanten verdwijnt geleidelijk. Daarnaast wordt de eigendomsbelasting gebaseerd op het 
aantal gereden kilometers in plaats van het voertuiggewicht. 
Verhoging tarief vliegbelasting 
De hervorming ‘verhoging van de vliegbelasting’ heeft als doel de sociale kosten van 
luchtvervoer beter weer te geven en korteafstandsvluchten te ontmoedigen. Dit wordt bereikt 
door een verhoging van de vliegbelasting. Dit leid t tot een hogere ticketprijs voor passagiers die 
vertrekken vanaf een Nederlandse luchthaven.  
Versnellen digitale transformatie 
Investeringen in onderzoek en innovatie zijn nodig om het duurzaam verdienvermogen van 
Nederland te vergroten. Bijvoorbeeld investeringen in kunstmatige intelligentie en 
kwantumtechnologie. Ze bevorderen de digitale  transformatie en bieden oplossingen voor 
maatschappelijke problemen. Dit zorgt voor duur zame economische groei. Ook is digitalisering 
van onderwijs en de logistieke sector belangrijk, net als het versterken van digitale vaardigheden. 
INVESTERINGEN 
Quantum Delta NL 
Quantum Delta NL stimuleert de ontwikkeling van kwantumtechnologie in Nederland. Dit 
gebeurt bijvoorbeeld via onderzoek, talentontwikkeling en de oprichting van nieuwe bedrijven. 
Het programma investeert in kwantumcomputers, -netwerken en sensoren. 
AiNed en Applied AI Learning Communities 
De investering AiNed en Applied AI Learning Communities stimuleert de ontwikkeling en 
toepassing van kunstmatige intelligentie (AI) in Nederland. Het doel is om de economie en 
samenleving te versterken. 
Digitaliseringsimpuls Onderwijs NL 
Deze investering bevordert de digitalisering in het beroeps- en hoger onderwijs. Het doel is om 
de digitale vaardigheden van studenten en docenten te verbeteren. De focus ligt op een 
gestandaardiseerde en veilige ICT- en kennisinfrastructuur.  
Digitale Infrastructuur Logistiek 
Dit programma stimuleert de digitalisering van de logistieke sector. Het ontwikkelt een veilige en 
betrouwbare data-infrastructuur voor het delen van gegevens. Het programma ondersteunt de 
opzet van deze basisdata-infrastructuur.  Zo kunnen commercieel gevoelige logistieke gegevens 
veilig gedeeld worden tussen ketenpartijen en de logistieke sector. 
Digitalisering van de strafrechtketen 
Deze investering maakt de strafrechtketen e Ưiciënter. Papierwerk wordt vervangen door digitale 
middelen. Het programma investeert in een portaal voor burgers. Hier kunnen zij strafrechtelijke 
handelingen uitvoeren, zoals aangiftes doen. Ook wordt IT verbeterd om strafzaken in de categorie “Veelvoorkomende criminaliteit” digitaal af te handelen. 
European Rail Tra Ưic Management  System (ERTMS) Deze investering vervangt het analoge treinbeveiligingssysteem door de Europese digitale norm, 
het European Rail Tra Ưic Management System (ERTMS). Het programma biedt bijvoorbeeld 
ﬁnanciële steun voor de ontwikkeling van pl anstudies voor verschillende baanvakken.  
Veilige, Slimme & Duurzame Mobiliteit 
De investering Veilige, Slimme & Duurzame Mobi liteit versnelt de overstap naar veiligere, 
slimmere en duurzamere mobiliteit. Dit gebeurt door beter gebruik te maken van de bestaande 
infrastructuur. Het programma biedt bijvoorbeeld ﬁnanciële steun voor slimme verkeerslichten. 
Intelligente Wegkantstations (IWKS) 
Deze investering vervangt de bestaande wegkantstations door intelligente wegkantstations 
(iWKS). Deze nieuwe systemen kunnen beter communiceren met elektronische verkeersborden. 
Ze helpen om ﬁles en congestie te verminderen, de verkeersdoorstroming te verbeteren en 
sneller te waarschuwen bij in cidenten. De iWKS worden e Ưiciënter, duurzamer en vereisen 
minder onderhoud. 
Hernieuwing van de IT-infrastructuur  bij het Ministerie van Defensie 
Deze maatregel vernieuwt de IT-infrastructuur van het ministerie van Defensie. Het doel is om 
betrouwbare, veilige en ﬂexibele systemen op te zetten. De investering ondersteunt het 
versterken van cyberbeveiliging.  
HERVORMINGEN Informatiemanagement overheid (Wet Open Overheid)  
Deze hervorming verbetert de transparantie van overheidsinformatie door de Wet open overheid 
(WOO). Overheidsinstanties moeten actieplannen  opstellen voor digitale toegankelijkheid. 
Versterken arbeidsmarkt, pensioen en toekomstgericht onderwijs 
De maatregelen richten zich op het aanpasse n van de arbeidsmarkt aan de veranderende 
economie door digitalisering, gl obalisering en de gevolgen van de coronapandemie. Het kabinet 
wil het rechtskader, de belasting- en pensioenstelsels en de inzetbaarheid van de 
beroepsbevolking beter afstemmen op de huidige omstandigheden. De focus ligt op het versterken van bestaanszekerheid voor lage en middeninkomens, het bevorderen van kansengelijkheid en het waarborgen van een adequaat pensioen voor alle generaties. 
INVESTERINGEN Nederland Leert Door 
Nederland Leert Door helpt mensen op de arbeid smarkt. Bijvoorbeeld door het ontwikkelen van 
vaardigheden of het ontvangen van loopbaanadvi es of loopbaanbegeleiding. Zo raken mensen 
minder snel hun baan kwijt. Ook helpt het we rklozen met het vinden van een nieuwe baan.  
Scholingsbudget WW 
Via deze regeling worden werklozen met een zwakke arbeidsmarktpositie ondersteunt. Door bij- 
en omscholing worden hun kansen op de arbeidsmarkt groter.  
Ondersteuning VO-leerlingen laatste jaar Leerlingen in het laatste jaar van het voortgezet  onderwijs zijn ondersteund om leerverliezen als 
gevolg van de coronapandemie te beperken. Er is bijvoorbeeld een online platform met leermateriaal gelanceerd. Ook hebben schoolbesturen extra middelen ontvangen.  
Aanpak voorkomen leervertraging bij nieuwkomers 
Basisscholen en middelbare scholen hebben middelen ontvangen om leerlingen met een 
migratieachtergrond die minder dan twee jaar in Nederland wonen te ondersteunen. Zo worden leerverliezen als gevolg van de coronapandemie verminderd.  
Laptops en tablets voor onderwijs 
Scholen hebben 75.000 laptops en tablets ontvangen. Zo kunnen scholen online en hybride 
onderwijs organiseren. Dit helpt bij het aanp akken van leerverliezen als gevolg van de 
coronapandemie. 
Nationaal Onderwijslab AI 
Kunstmatige intelligentie kan helpen om het leerproces in het onderwijs te verbeteren. 
Bijvoorbeeld door kennis van leerli ngen en docenten te vergroten. Of door de motivatie van 
leerlingen te versterken. Deze maatregel ﬁnanciert zulke projecten.  
 
HERVORMINGEN Verlaging van de zelfstandigenaftrek 
De zelfstandigenaftrek is een aftrekpost voor ondernemers. Dit zorg ervoor dat ze minder 
belasting betalen dan werknemers. Door de zelfstan digenaftrek te verlagen wordt het verschil in 
ﬁscale behandeling kleiner.  
Hervorming pensioenstelsel tweede pijler 
Deze hervorming maakt het Nederlandse pensioenstelsel klaar voor de toekomst. De wet zorgt 
dat de pensioenopbouw gelijk is aan de premie. Zo wordt het pensioenstelsel eerlijker en 
transparanter. Ook is het stelsel op deze manier schokbestendiger. 
Arbeidsongeschiktheidsverzekering voor zelfstandigen  
Zelfstandigen hebben meer sociale bescherming als ze een arbeidsongeschiktheidsverzekering 
hebben. Daarnaast is er op die manier meer ge lijkheid tussen zelfstandigen en werknemers.  
Aanpak schijnzelfstandigheid 
Er is schijnzelfstandigheid wanneer iemand als zzp’er werkt, maar er volgens het arbeidsrecht 
eigenlijk sprake zou moeten zijn van een dienst verband. Schijnzelfstandigen kunnen belastingen 
en premies mislopen. Ook kunnen ze minder sociale bescherming hebben. Schijnzelfstandigheid wordt aangepakt d oor duidelijkere regels te maken.  
 
Verbeteren woningmarkt en verduurzamen gebouwde omgeving De maatregelen in dit thema richten zich op he t aanpakken van problemen op de woningmarkt. 
Er is bijvoorbeeld een woningbouwtekort en er wo rden te weinig betaalbare woningen gebouwd. 
Ook gebruikt de gebouwde omgeving veel energie.  
 INVESTERINGEN 
Investeringssubsidie duurzame energie en energiebesparing (ISDE) 
Met een ISDE-subsidie worden woningen verduurzaamd. Bijvoorbeeld door een aansluiting op 
het warmtenet, of het installeren van ee n warmtepomp, zonneboiler of elektrische 
kookvoorziening. Op deze manier daalt de vraag naar energie.  
Subsidieregeling duurzaam maatschappelijk vastgoed 
Met deze subsidie wordt maatschappelijk vastgoed verduurzaamd. Dit zijn bijvoorbeeld scholen, 
overheidsgebouwen, monumenten en zorginstellingen. Zo is er minder vraag naar energie.  
Woningbouwimpuls 
De Woningbouwimpuls is een subsidie voor ge meenten. Nieuwe huizen kunnen hierdoor niet 
alleen sneller worden gebouwd, ze zijn ook betaalbaarder. Daarnaast kunnen gemeenten met dit 
geld meer nieuwe huizen bouwen.  
HERVORMINGEN 
AfschaƯen verruimde schenkingsvr ijstelling eigen woning 
Met deze maatregel is de belastingvrijstelling voor schenkingen waarmee jongeren een woning 
kunnen kopen afgeschaft. Op deze manier is er  minder verstoring en ongelijkheid op de 
woningmarkt. Ook neemt de vermogensongelijkheid af.  
Regie op de aanbodzijd e van de woningmarkt 
De rijksoverheid, provincies en gemeenten maken afspraken over het bouwen van nieuwe 
huizen. In 2030 moeten 900.000 nieuwe woningen  gebouwd zijn. Hiervan moeten er minstens 
600.000 betaalbaar zijn.  
AfschaƯen leegwaarderatio 
Het doel van deze hervorming is om de belastin g op huurhuizen beter te laten passen bij de 
echte waarde. Met deze hervorming wordt de leegwaarderatio in Nederland verhoogd. Nu wordt 
bij de belasting op huizen die niet door de eigenaar worden bewoond, gedacht dat de waarde te hoog is. Daarom wordt de waarde van verhuurde huizen aangepast met de leegwaarderatio, wat 
een belastingkorting geeft aan eigenaren. Deze  belastingkorting wordt nu minder groot.  
Aanscherping inkomensafhankel ijke hogere huurverhoging 
Via deze wetswijziging kunnen huurprijzen beter afgestemd worden op het inkomen van de 
huurder. Huurverhogingen worden namelijk geba seerd op twee inkomensgroepen. De maximale 
huurverhoging per maand voor huurders met een hoog inkomen wordt €100. Voor huurders met 
een gemiddeld inkomen wordt dit €50.  
Versnellen van proces en procedures bij realiseren van woningbouw Het duurt gemiddeld 10 jaar voordat een huis gebouwd is. Dit komt bijvoorbeeld doordat er 
lange procedures zijn. Ook zijn er veel eisen waar de nieuwe huizen aan moeten voldoen. Via deze maatregel wordt een actieplan opgesteld om de bouw van nieuwe woningen te versnellen.  
Versterken energiemarkt (REPowerEU) 
REPowerEU helpt lidstaten om minder afha nkelijk te worden van fossiele brandsto Ưen uit 
Rusland. Hier hebben lidstaten extra geld voor gekregen. Nederland heeft twee maatregelen aan 
het plan toegevoegd. 
INVESTERINGEN 
Opschaling Investeringssubsidie duurzame energie en energiebesparing (ISDE) 
Nederland heeft de maatregel ‘Investeringssubsidie duurzame energie en energiebesparing 
(ISDE) opgeschaald. Dit betekent dat er me er subsidies worden gegeven om huizen te 
verduurzamen.  
HERVORMINGEN Hervormingspakket energiemarkt 
De Nederlandse energiemarkt kent een aant al uitdagingen. Zo is het druk op het 
elektriciteitsnet. Ook is het nodig dat hernieuwbare energieprojecten snel van start kunnen. Met 
nieuwe wet- en regelgeving pakt Nederland deze uitdagingen aan.  
 
Aanpakken agressieve belastingplanning en witwassen 
Deze maatregelen zijn gericht tegen belastingontwijking. Daarnaast zorgen deze maatregelen 
ook voor een verbreding van de belastinggrondslag en een meer evenwichtige belastinghe Ưing 
van multinationals. 
HERVORMINGEN 
Nederlands beleid omtrent bronbelasting 
Deze hervorming moet belastingontwijking tegengaa n. Er komt een belasting op rente-, royalty- 
en dividendbetalingen naar landen met weinig of geen belasting en bij misbruik. Ook wordt bijgehouden wat de e Ưecten van deze maatregel zijn.  
Voorkomen van vrijstelling door speci ﬁeke renteaftrek beperking 
De hervorming Voorkomen va n vrijstelling door speci ﬁeke renteaftrekbeperking zorgt ervoor dat 
bedrijven geen onterechte belastingvrijstellin g krijgen door een renteaftrekregel in de 
vennootschapsbelasting. Dit voorkomt vrijstelling bij negatieve rente en positieve valutaresultaten.  
Anti witwasbeleid 
De hervorming Anti-witwasbeleid versterkt de aa npak van witwassen en crimineel misbruik van 
het ﬁnanciële stelsel. Dit gebeurt door extra person eel aan te nemen bij de Financial Intelligence 
Unit-Nederland. Ook wordt een wet ingevoerd die hoge contante betalingen vermindert. 
Tegengaan mismatches bij toepassing zakelijkheidsbeginsel Het doel van de hervorming is belastingm ismatches te voorkomen die ontstaan door 
verschillende interpretaties van het zakelijkheidsbeg insel, vooral in internationale situaties. Het 
zakelijkheidsbeginsel houdt in dat betalingen tussen verbonden bedrijven (bijvoorbeeld tussen 
moeder- en dochtermaatschappijen) moeten plaatsvinden onder voorwaarden die ook zouden 
gelden als de bedrijven onafhankelijk van elkaar  waren. Door deze hervorming wordt er voor 
gezorgd dat winst op de juiste manier wordt belast en dat dit duidelijker wordt voor bedrijven. 
Beperking liquidatie en stakingsverliesregeling 
Het doel van deze hervorming is de aftrekbaarhe id van liquidatie- en stakingsverliezen in de 
vennootschapsbelasting te beperken.  
Beperking verliesverrekening 
Het doel van deze hervorming is de mogelijkhe id om winsten te verrekenen met verliezen uit

Versterken gezondheidszorg en pandemieparaatheid 
De Nederlandse gezondheidszorg kent een groot personeelstekort. De HVP-maatregelen onder 
deze noemer zijn gericht op het (tijdelijk) inpe rken van dit tekort. Daarnaast was er tijdens de 
coronacrisis sprake van een tekort aan Intensive  Care-capaciteit. De HVP-maatregelen zijn er 
daarom ook op gericht deze capaciteit uit te  breiden en de pandemische paraatheid te 
versterken. 
INVESTERINGEN Tijdelijke extra personele capaciteit voor zorg in crisistijd 
Deze investering zorgt voor voldoende personeel in de zorg tijdens crises. Het programma biedt 
bijvoorbeeld ﬁnanciële steun voor onderwijs en ""on the job training"" voor mbo- en hbo-
studenten in de zorg.  
Uitbreiding Intensive Care 
De investering Uitbreiding intensive care vergroot de ziekenhuiscapaciteit voor de zorg aan 
COVID-19-patiënten. Het programma biedt bijvoorbeeld ﬁnanciële steun aan 54 ziekenhuizen 
voor het aanpassen van faciliteiten en het uitb reiden van het aantal IC-bedden, zowel vast als 
ﬂexibel. 
Stimuleringsregeling E health Thuis 
Deze investering ondersteunt de zorg voor thuiswonende ouderen en mensen met een 
kwetsbare gezondheid via e-healthoplossingen. Het programma biedt ﬁnanciële steun aan 
zorgverleners voor het gebruik van toepas singen zoals online gezondheidszorg via 
videoverbinding, diagnose-apps en digitale geneesmiddelenverstrekkers.

DIRECTIVES
DIRECTIVE (EU) 2023/1791 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL 
of 13 September 2023
on energy efficiency and amending Regulation (EU) 2023/955 (recast) 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 194(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national Parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),
Whereas:
(1) Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (4)has been substantially amended several 
times (5). Since further amendments are to be made, that Directive should be recast in the interests of clarity.
(2) In its communication of 17 September 2020 on ‘Stepping up Europe’s 2030 climate ambition – Investing in a 
climate-neutral future for the benefit of our people’ (the ‘Climate Target Plan’), the Commission proposed to raise 
the Union’s climate ambition by increasing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions target to at least 55 % below 1990 
levels by 2030. That is a substantial increase compared to the existing 40 % reduction target. The proposal delivered 
on the commitment made in the communication of the Commission of 11 December 2019 on ‘The European Green 
Deal’ (the ‘European Green Deal’) to put forward a comprehensive plan to increase the Union’s target for 2030 towards 55 % in a responsible way. It is also in accordance with the objectives of the Paris Agreement adopted on 
12 December 2015 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the ‘Paris Agreement’) to 
keep the global temperature increase to well below 2 °C and pursue efforts to keep it to 1,5 °C.

(3)Position of the European Parliament of 11 July 2023 (not yet published in the Official Journal) and decision of the Council of 25 July 
2023.
(4)Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on energy efficiency, amending 
Directives 2009/125/EC and 2010/30/EU and repealing Directives 2004/8/EC and 2006/32/EC (OJ L 315, 14.11.2012, p. 1).
(5)See Part A of Annex XVI.EN Official Journal of the European Union 20.9.2023 L 231/1  (3) The conclusions of the European Council of 10-11 December 2020 endorsed the Union’s binding domestic 
reduction target for net GHG emissions of at least 55 % by 2030 compared to 1990. The European Council 
concluded that the climate ambition needed to be raised in a manner that would spur sustainable economic growth, create jobs, deliver health and environmental benefits for Union citizens, and contribute to the long-term global 
competitiveness of the Union’s economy by promoting innovation in green technologies.
(4) To implement those objectives, the Commission, in its communication of 19 October 2020 on ‘Commission Work 
Programme 2021 – A Union of vitality in a world of fragility’, announced a legislative package to reduce GHG 
emissions by at least 55 % by 2030 (the ‘Fit for 55 package’), and to achieve a climate-neutral European Union by 
2050. That package covers a range of policy areas including energy efficiency, renewable energy, land use, land 
change and forestry, energy taxation, effort sharing and emissions trading.
(5) The purpose of the Fit for 55 package is to safeguard and create jobs in the Union and to enable the Union to become 
a world leader in the development and uptake of clean technologies in the global energy transition, including energy 
efficiency solutions.
(6) Projections indicate that, with the full implementation of current policies, GHG emission reductions by 2030 would 
be around 45 % compared to 1990 levels, when excluding land use emissions and absorptions, and around 47 %, 
when including them. The Climate Target Plan therefore provides for a set of required actions across all sectors of 
the economy and revisions of the key legislative instruments to reach that increased climate ambition.
(7) In its communication of 28 November 2018 on ‘A Clean Planet for all – A European strategic long-term vision for a 
prosperous, modern, competitive and climate neutral economy’, the Commission stated that energy efficiency is a 
key area of action, without which the full decarbonisation of the Union’s economy cannot be achieved. The need to 
capture the cost-effective energy saving opportunities has led to the Union’s current energy efficiency policy. In 
December 2018, a new 2030 Union headline energy efficiency target of at least 32,5 %, compared to projected energy use in 2030, was included as part of the Clean Energy for All Europeans package, which aimed at putting 
energy efficiency first, achieving global leadership in renewable energies and providing a fair deal for consumers.
(8) The impact assessment accompanying the Climate Target Plan demonstrated that, to achieve the increased climate 
ambition, energy efficiency improvements will need to be significantly raised from the current level of 32,5 %.
(9) An increase in the Union’s 2030 energy efficiency target can reduce energy prices and be crucial in reducing GHG 
emissions, accompanied by an increase and uptake of electrification, hydrogen, e-fuels and other relevant 
technologies necessary for the green transition, including in the transport sector. Even with the rapid growth of renewable electricity generation, energy efficiency can reduce the need of new power generation capacity and the costs relating to storage, transmission and distribution. Increased energy efficiency is also particularly important for 
the security of the energy supply of the Union, by lowering the Union’s dependence on the import of fuels from third 
countries. Energy efficiency is one of the cleanest and most cost-efficient measures by which to address 
that dependence.
(10) The sum of national contributions communicated by Member States in their national energy and climate plans falls 
short of the Union’s target of 32,5 %. The contributions would collectively lead to a reduction of 29,7 % for 
primary energy consumption and 29,4 % for final energy consumption compared to the projections from the 
Commission’s 2007 EU Reference Scenario for 2030. That would translate in a collective gap of 2,8 percentage 
points for primary energy consumption and 3,1 percentage points for final energy consumption for the EU-27.EN Official Journal of the European Union L 231/2 20.9.2023  (11) A number of Member States presented ambitious national energy and climate plans, which were assessed by the 
Commission as ‘sufficient’, and which contained measures that allow those Member States to contribute to reaching 
the collective targets for energy efficiency with a ratio larger than the Union average. In addition, a number of Member States have documented ‘early efforts’ in achieving energy savings, namely energy savings above the Union 
average trajectories in the last years. Both cases are significant efforts that should be recognised and should be 
included in the Union’s future modelling projections and that can serve as good examples of how all Member States 
can work on their energy efficiency potential to deliver significant benefits to their economies and societies.
(12) In some cases, the assumptions used by the Commission in its 2020 EU Reference Scenario and the assumptions 
used by some Member States for their reference scenarios underpinning their national energy and climate plans are 
different. This may lead to divergences as regards the calculation of primary energy consumption but both 
approaches are valid with regard to primary energy consumption.
(13) While the energy savings potential remains large in all sectors, there is a particular challenge relating to transport, as it is responsible for more than 30 % of final energy consumption, and to buildings, since 75 % of the Union’s building stock has a poor energy performance. Another increasingly important sector is the information and communications technology (ICT) sector, which is responsible for 5 to 9 % of the world’s total electricity use and 
more than 2 % of global emissions. In 2018, data centres accounted for 2,7 % of the electricity demand in the 
EU-28. In that context, the Commission, in its communication of 19 February 2020 on ‘Shaping Europe's digital 
future’ (the ‘Union’s Digital Strategy’), highlighted the need for highly energy-efficient and sustainable data centres 
and transparency measures for telecoms operators as regards their environmental footprint. Furthermore, the 
possible increase in industry’s energy demand that may result from its decarbonisation, particularly for energy intensive processes, should also be taken into account.
(14) The higher level of ambition requires a stronger promotion of cost-effective energy efficiency measures in all areas of the energy system and in all relevant sectors where activity affects energy demand, such as the transport, water and agriculture sectors. Improving energy efficiency throughout the full energy chain, including energy generation, 
transmission, distribution and end-use, will benefit the environment, improve air quality and public health, reduce 
GHG emissions, improve energy security by decreasing the need for energy imports, in particular of fossil fuels, cut 
energy costs for households and companies, help alleviate energy poverty, and lead to increased competitiveness, 
more jobs and increased economic activity throughout the economy. Improving energy efficiency would thus 
improve citizens’ quality of life, while contributing to the transformation of the Union’s energy relations with third- country partners towards achieving climate neutrality. That complies with the Union commitments made in the framework of the Energy Union and global climate agenda established by the Paris Agreement. Improving the 
energy performance of various sectors has the potential of fostering urban regeneration, including improvement of 
buildings, and changes in mobility and accessibility patterns, while promoting more efficient, sustainable and affordable options.
(15) This Directive takes a step forward towards climate neutrality by 2050, under which energy efficiency is to be treated 
as an energy source in its own right. The energy efficiency first principle is an overarching principle that should be 
taken into account across all sectors, going beyond the energy system, at all levels, including in the financial sector. 
Energy efficiency solutions should be considered as the first option in policy, planning and investment decisions when setting new rules for the supply side and other policy areas. While the energy efficiency first principle should be applied without prejudice to other legal obligations, objectives and principles, such obligations, objectives and 
principles should not hamper its application or lead to exemptions from applying the principle. The Commission 
should ensure that energy efficiency and demand response can compete on equal terms with generation capacity. Energy efficiency improvements need to be made whenever they are more cost-effective than equivalent supply-side 
solutions. That should help exploit the multiple benefits of energy efficiency for the Union, in particular for citizens 
and businesses. Implementing energy efficiency improvement measures should also be a priority in alleviating 
energy poverty.EN Official Journal of the European Union 20.9.2023 L 231/3  (16) Energy efficiency should be recognised as a crucial element and a priority consideration in future investment 
decisions on the Union’s energy infrastructure. The energy efficiency first principle should be applied taking into 
consideration primarily the system efficiency approach and societal and health perspective, and paying attention to security of supply, energy system integration and the transition to climate neutrality. Consequently, the energy efficiency first principle should help increase the efficiency of individual end-use sectors and of the whole energy system. The application of the principle should also support investments in energy-efficient solutions contributing to the environmental objectives of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council (
6).
(17) The energy efficiency first principle is provided for in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council (
7)and is at the core of the EU Strategy for Energy System Integration established in the Commission’s 
communication of 8 July 2022. While the principle is based on cost-effectiveness, its application has wider 
implications from the societal perspective. Those implications can vary depending on the circumstances and should be carefully evaluated through robust cost-benefit analysis methodologies that take into account the multiple 
benefits of energy efficiency. The Commission has prepared dedicated guidelines for the operation and application 
of the principle, by proposing specific tools and examples of application in various sectors. The Commission has also issued a recommendation to Member States that builds on the requirements laid down in this Directive and 
calls for specific actions in relation to the application of the principle. Member States should take the utmost 
account of that recommendation and be guided by it in implementing the energy efficiency principle in practice.
(18) The energy efficiency first principle implies adopting a holistic approach, which takes into account the overall efficiency of the integrated energy system, security of supply and cost effectiveness and promotes the most efficient 
solutions for climate neutrality across the whole value chain, from energy production, network transport to final 
energy consumption, so that efficiencies are achieved in both primary energy consumption and final energy consumption. That approach should look at the system performance and dynamic use of energy, where demand- side resources and system flexibility are considered to be energy efficiency solutions.
(19) In order to have an impact, the energy efficiency first principle needs to be consistently applied by national, regional, local and sectoral decision makers in all relevant scenarios and policy, planning and major investment decisions – that is to say large-scale investments with a value of more than EUR 100 000 000 each or EUR 175 000 000 for 
transport infrastructure projects – affecting energy consumption or supply. The proper application of the principle requires using the right cost-benefit analysis methodology, setting enabling conditions for energy efficient solutions 
and proper monitoring. Cost-benefit analyses should be systematically developed and carried out, should be based 
on the most up-to-date information on energy prices and should include scenarios for rising prices, such as due to 
decreasing Union’s emission trading system (EU ETS) allowances pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (
8), in order to provide an incentive to apply energy efficiency measures. Priority 
should be given to demand-side solutions where they are more cost-effective than investments in energy supply infrastructure in meeting policy objectives. Demand-side flexibility can bring wider economic, environmental and 
societal benefits to consumers and to society at large, including local communities, and can increase the efficiency 
of the energy system and decrease the energy costs, for example by reducing system operation costs resulting in lower tariffs for all consumers. Member States should take into account potential benefits from demand-side flexibility in applying the energy efficiency first principle and where relevant consider demand response at both 
centralised and decentralised level, energy storage, and smart solutions as part of their efforts to increase efficiency 
of the integrated energy system.

Commission, in its report to the European Parliament and to the Council, should assess, in particular, whether and 
in what manner the thresholds are effectively applied in each Member State.
(21) The energy efficiency first principle should always be applied in a proportional way and the requirements laid down 
in this Directive should not entail overlapping or conflicting obligations on Member States, where the application of 
the principle is ensured directly by other legislation. This might be the case for the projects of common interest 
included in the Union list pursuant to Article 3 of Regulation (EU) 2022/869 of the European Parliament and of the 
Council (9), which introduces the requirements to consider the energy efficiency first principle in the development 
and assessment for those projects.
(22) A fair transition towards a climate-neutral Union by 2050 is central to the European Green Deal. Energy poverty is a key concept in the Clean Energy for All Europeans package and designed to facilitate a just energy transition. 
Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 and Directive (EU) 2019/944 of the European Parliament and of the 
Council (
10), the Commission, in its Recommendation (EU) 2020/1563 on energy poverty (11), provided indicative 
guidance on appropriate indicators for measuring energy poverty and defining a ‘significant number of households in energy poverty’. Directive 2009/73/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (
12)and Directive 
(EU) 2019/944 require Member States to take appropriate measures to address energy poverty wherever it is identified, including measures addressing the broader context of poverty. This is particularly relevant in a context of 
rising energy prices and inflationary pressure, where both short and long-term measures should be implemented to 
address systemic challenges to the Union’s energy system.
(23) People facing or risking energy poverty, vulnerable customers, including final users, low- and medium-income households, and people living in social housing should benefit from the application of the energy efficiency first principle. Energy efficiency measures should be implemented as a priority to improve the situations of those 
individuals and households and to alleviate energy poverty, and should not encourage any disproportionate increase 
in housing, mobility or energy costs. A holistic approach in policy making and in implementing policies and measures requires Member States to ensure that other policies and measures have no adverse effect on those individuals and households.
(24) This Directive is part of a broader policy framework of energy efficiency policies addressing energy efficiency potentials in specific policy areas, including buildings (Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the 
Council (
13)), products (Directive 2009/125/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (14)and Regulations 
(EU) 2017/1369 (15)and (EU) 2020/740 (16)of the European Parliament and of the Council), and governance 
(Regulation (EU) 2018/1999). Those policies play a very important role in delivering energy savings when products 
are replaced or buildings constructed or renovated.

energy efficiency measures. The Clean Energy Transition sub-programme of the Union’s LIFE Programme, 
established by Regulation (EU) 2021/783 of the European Parliament and of the Council (17), will dedicate funding 
to support development of Union best practices in energy efficiency policy implementation, addressing behavioural, market, and regulatory barriers to energy efficiency.
(26) The European Council, in its conclusion of 23and 24 October 2014, supported a 27 % energy efficiency target for 
2030 at Union level, to be reviewed by 2020 having in mind a Union-level target of 30 %. In its resolution of 15 December 2015 entitled ‘Towards a European Energy Union’, the European Parliament called on the 
Commission to assess, in addition, the viability of a 40 % energy efficiency target for the same timeframe.
(27) In its communication of 28 November 2018 on ‘A Clean Planet for all – A European strategic long-term vision for a 
prosperous, modern, competitive and climate neutral economy’, the Commission projects that the 32,5 % Union’s energy efficiency target for 2030 and the other policy instruments of the existing framework would lead to a 
reduction in GHG emissions of about 45 % by 2030. For an increased climate ambition of a 55 % decrease of GHG 
emissions by 2030, the impact assessment of the Climate Target Plan assessed what level of efforts would be needed 
in the different policy areas. It concluded that, in relation to the baseline, achieving the GHG emissions target in a cost-optimal way meant that primary energy consumption and final energy consumption are to decrease by at least 
39 to 41 % and 36 to 37 % respectively.
(28) The Union’s energy efficiency target was initially set and calculated using the 2007 EU Reference Scenario 
projections for 2030 as a baseline. The change in the Eurostat energy balance calculation methodology and improvements in subsequent modelling projections call for a change of the baseline. Thus, using the same approach 
to define the target, namely by comparing it to the future baseline projections, the ambition of the Union’s 2030 
energy efficiency target is set compared to the 2020 EU Reference Scenario projections for 2030 reflecting national 
contributions from the national energy and climate plans. With that updated baseline, the Union will need to further 
increase its energy efficiency ambition by at least 11,7 % in 2030 compared to the level of efforts under the 2020 EU 
Reference Scenario. The new way of expressing the level of ambition for the Union’s targets does not affect the actual 
level of efforts needed and corresponds to a reduction of 40,5 % for primary energy consumption and 38 % for final 
energy consumption when compared to the 2007 EU Reference Scenario projections for 2030.
(29) The methodology for calculation of primary energy consumption and final energy consumption is aligned with the 
new Eurostat methodology, but the indicators used for the purpose of this Directive have a different scope, in that they exclude ambient energy and include energy consumption in international aviation for the targets in primary energy consumption and final energy consumption. The use of new indicators also implies that any changes in 
energy consumption of blast furnaces are now only reflected in primary energy consumption.
(30) The need for the Union to improve its energy efficiency should be expressed in primary energy consumption and 
final energy consumption, to be achieved in 2030, indicating an additional level of efforts required when compared 
to the measures in place or planned measures in the national energy and climate plans. The 2020 EU Reference 
Scenario projects 864 Mtoe of final energy consumption and 1 124 Mtoe of primary energy consumption to be 
reached in 2030 (excluding ambient energy and including international aviation). An additional reduction of 11,7 % 
results in 763 Mtoe and 992,5 Mtoe in 2030. Compared to 2005 levels, it means that final energy consumption in 
the Union should be reduced by approximately 25 % and primary energy consumption should be reduced by 
approximately 34 %. There are no binding targets at Member State level in the 2020 and 2030 perspectives, and 
Member States should establish their contributions to the achievement of the Union’s energy efficiency target taking 
(17)Regulation (EU) 2021/783 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2021 establishing a Programme for the 
Environment and Climate Action (LIFE), and repealing Regulation (EU) No 1293/2013 (OJ L 172, 17.5.2021, p. 53).EN Official Journal of the European Union L 231/6 20.9.2023  into account the formula provided for in this Directive. Member States should be free to set their national objectives 
based either on primary energy consumption or final energy consumption or primary energy savings or final energy 
savings, or on energy intensity. This Directive amends the way in which Member States should express their national contributions to the Union’s target. Member States’ contributions to the Union’s target should be expressed in primary energy consumption and final energy consumption to ensure consistency and monitoring of progress. A 
regular evaluation of progress towards the achievement of the Union’s 2030 targets is necessary and is provided for 
in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999.
(31) By 30 November 2023, the Commission should update the 2020 EU Reference Scenario based on the latest Eurostat 
data. Member States wishing to use the updated reference scenario should notify their updated national 
contributions by 1 February 2024, as part of the iterative process provided for in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999.
(32) It would be preferable for the energy efficiency targets to be achieved as a result of the cumulative implementation of specific Union and national measures promoting energy efficiency in different fields. Member States should be 
required to set national energy efficiency policies and measures. Those policies and measures and the individual 
efforts of each Member State should be evaluated by the Commission, alongside data on the progress made, to 
assess the likelihood of achieving the overall Union target and the extent to which the individual efforts are 
sufficient to meet the common goal.
(33) The public sector is responsible for approximately 5 % to 10 % of the Union’s total final energy consumption. Public 
authorities spend approximately EUR 1 800 000 000 000 every year. This represents around 14 % of the Union’s 
gross domestic product. For that reason the public sector constitutes an important driver to stimulate market 
transformation towards more efficient products, buildings and services, as well as to trigger behavioural changes in energy consumption by citizens and enterprises. Furthermore, decreasing energy consumption through energy 
efficiency improvement measures can free up public resources for other purposes. Public bodies at national, 
regional and local level should fulfil an exemplary role as regards energy efficiency.
(34) To lead by example, the public sector should set its own decarbonisation and energy efficiency goals. Energy 
efficiency improvements in the public sector should reflect the efforts required at Union level. To comply with the 
final energy consumption target, the Union should decrease its final energy consumption by 19 % by 2030 as compared to the average energy consumption in years 2017, 2018 and 2019. An obligation to achieve an annual 
reduction of the energy consumption in the public sector by at least 1,9 % should ensure that the public sector 
fulfils its exemplary role. Member States retain full flexibility regarding the choice of energy efficiency improvement 
measures to achieve a reduction of the final energy consumption. Requiring an annual reduction of final energy consumption has a lower administrative burden than establishing measurement methods for energy savings.
(35) To fulfil their obligation, Member States should target the final energy consumption of all public services and installations of public bodies. To determine the scope of addressees, Member States should apply the definition of 
‘public bodies’ provided for in this Directive, where ‘directly financed by those authorities’ means that those entities 
are mostly funded by public funds and ‘administered by those authorities’ means that a national, regional or local 
authority has a majority with regard to the choice of the entity’s management. The obligation can be fulfilled by the 
reduction of final energy consumption in any area of the public sector, including transport, public buildings, 
healthcare, spatial planning, water management and wastewater treatment, sewage and water purification, waste 
management, district heating and cooling, energy distribution, supply and storage, public lighting, infrastructure 
planning, education and social services. Member States may also include other types of services when transposing 
this Directive. To lower the administrative burden for public bodies, Member States should establish digital platforms or tools to collect the aggregated consumption data from public bodies, make them publicly available, 
and report the data to the Commission. Member States should provide planning and annual reporting on the 
consumption of public bodies in an aggregated form per sector.EN Official Journal of the European Union 20.9.2023 L 231/7  (36) Member States should promote energy efficient means of mobility, including in their public procurement practices, 
such as rail, cycling, walking or shared mobility, by renewing and decarbonising fleets, encouraging a modal shift 
and including those modes in urban mobility planning.
(37) Member States should exercise an exemplary role by ensuring that all energy performance contracts, energy audits and energy management systems are carried out in the public sector in line with European or international 
standards, or that energy audits are used to a large extent in energy-intense parts of the public sector. Member States 
should provide guidance and should provide for procedures for the use of those instruments.
(38) Public authorities are encouraged to obtain support from entities such as sustainable energy agencies established at regional or local level, where applicable. The organisation of those agencies usually reflects the individual needs of 
public authorities in a certain region or operating in a certain area of the public sector. Centralised agencies can 
serve the needs better and work more effectively in other respects, for example, in smaller or centralised Member 
States or regarding complex or cross-regional aspects such as district heating and cooling. Sustainable energy 
agencies can serve as one-stop shops. Those agencies are often responsible for developing local or regional 
decarbonisation plans, which may also include other decarbonisation measures, such as the exchange of fossil fuel boilers, and for supporting public authorities in the implementation of energy-related policies. Sustainable energy 
agencies or other entities to assist regional and local authorities may have clear competences, objectives and 
resources in the field of sustainable energy. Sustainable energy agencies could be encouraged to consider initiatives taken in the framework of the Covenant of Mayors, which brings together local governments voluntarily committed 
to implementing the Union’s climate and energy objectives, and other existing initiatives for that purpose. The 
decarbonisation plans should be linked to territorial development plans and take into account the comprehensive assessment which the Member States should carry out.
(39) Member States should support public bodies in planning and the uptake of energy efficiency improvement measures, 
including at regional and local level, by providing guidelines promoting competence-building and training 
opportunities and encouraging cooperation amongst public bodies including amongst agencies. For that purpose, Member States could set up national competence centres on complex issues, such as advising local or regional 
energy agencies on district heating or cooling. The requirement to transform buildings into nearly zero-energy 
buildings does not exclude or prohibit a differentiation between nearly zero-energy building levels for new or 
renovated buildings. Nearly zero-energy buildings, including the cost-optimal level, are defined 
in Directive 2010/31/EU.
(40) Until the end of 2026, Member States that renovate more than 3 % of the total floor area of their buildings in any 
given year should be given the possibility to count the surplus towards the annual renovation rate of any of the three following years. A Member State that renovates more than 3 % of the total floor area of its buildings from 
1 January 2027 should be able to count the surplus towards the annual renovation rate of the following two years. 
That possibility should not be used for purposes that are not in line with the general objectives and the level of 
ambition of this Directive.
(41) Member States should encourage public bodies to take into account the wider benefits beyond energy savings, such 
as the quality of the indoor environment as well as an improvement of people’s quality of life and the comfort of 
renovated public buildings, in particular schools, day care centres, nursing homes, sheltered housing, hospitals, and social housing.
(42) Buildings and transport, alongside industry, are the main energy users and main source of emissions. Buildings are 
responsible for about 40 % of the Union’s total energy consumption and for 36 % of its GHG from energy. The 
Commission communication of 14 October 2020, entitled ‘Renovation Wave’ addresses the twin challenge of 
energy and resource efficiency and affordability in the building sector and aims to double the renovation rate. It 
focuses on the worst performing buildings, energy poverty and on public buildings. Moreover, buildings are crucial 
to achieving the Union objective of reaching climate neutrality by 2050. Buildings that are owned by public bodies 
account for a considerable share of the building stock and have high visibility in public life. It is therefore 
appropriate to set an annual rate of renovation of buildings that are owned by public bodies on the territory of a EN Official Journal of the European Union L 231/8 20.9.2023  Member State to upgrade their energy performance and be transformed into at least nearly zero-energy buildings or 
zero-emission buildings. Member States are invited to set a higher renovation rate, where that is cost-effective in the 
framework of the renovation of their buildings stock in accordance with their long-term renovation strategies or 
national renovation programmes, or both. That renovation rate should be without prejudice to the obligations with 
regard to nearly zero-energy buildings set out in Directive 2010/31/EU. Member States should be able to apply less 
stringent requirements to some buildings, such as buildings with special architectural or historical merit. During the 
next review of Directive 2010/31/EU, the Commission should assess the progress Member States achieved regarding 
the renovation of public bodies’ buildings. The Commission should consider submitting a legislative proposal to 
revise the renovation rate, while taking into account the progress achieved by the Member States, substantial economic or technical developments, or where needed, the Union’s commitments for decarbonisation and zero 
pollution. The obligation to renovate public bodies’ buildings in this Directive complements that in 
Directive 2010/31/EU, which requires Member States to ensure that when existing buildings undergo major 
renovation their energy performance is upgraded so that they meet the requirements on nearly zero-energy 
buildings.
(43) Building automation and control systems and other solutions to provide active energy management are important 
tools for public bodies to improve and maintain the energy performance of buildings, as well as ensuring the 
necessary indoor conditions in the buildings they own or occupy, in accordance with Directive 2010/31/EU.
(44) Promoting green mobility is a key part of the European Green Deal. The provision of charging infrastructure is one of the necessary elements in the transition. Charging infrastructure in buildings is particularly important since 
electric vehicles park in buildings regularly and for long periods of time, thus making charging easier and more 
efficient. Public bodies should make best efforts to install charging infrastructure in buildings they own or occupy in 
accordance with Directive 2010/31/EU.
(45) To set the rate of renovations, Member States need to have an overview of the buildings that do not reach the nearly 
zero-energy buildings level. Therefore, Member States should publish and keep updated an inventory of public 
buildings, including, where appropriate, social housing, as part of an overall database of energy performance 
certificates. That inventory should also enable private actors, including energy service companies (ESCOs), to 
propose renovation solutions, which can be aggregated by the EU Building Stock Observatory.
(46) The inventory could integrate data from existing building stock inventories. Member States should take appropriate 
measures to facilitate data collection and make the inventory accessible to private actors, including ESCOs to enable 
their active role in renovation solutions. Available and publicly shared data about building stock characteristics, 
buildings renovation and energy performance may be aggregated by the EU Building Stock Observatory to ensure a 
better understanding of the energy performance of the building sector through comparable data.
(47) In 2020, more than half of the world’s population lived in urban areas. That figure is expected to reach 68 % by 
2050. In addition, half of the urban infrastructures by 2050 are still to be built. Cities and metropolitan areas are 
centres of economic activity, knowledge generation, innovation and new technologies. Cities influence the quality of 
life of the citizens who live or work in them. Member States should support municipalities technically and 
financially. A number of municipalities and other public bodies in the Member States have already put into place 
integrated approaches to energy saving and energy supply and sustainable mobility, for example via sustainable 
energy action plans or sustainable urban mobility plans, such as those developed under the Covenant of Mayors 
initiative, and integrated urban approaches which go beyond individual interventions in buildings or transport 
modes. Further efforts are needed in the area of improving the energy efficiency of urban mobility, for both 
passenger and freight transport, as it uses around 40 % of all road transport energy.EN Official Journal of the European Union 20.9.2023 L 231/9  (48) All the principles of Directives 2014/23/EU (18), 2014/24/EU (19)and 2014/25/EU (20)of the European Parliament 
and of the Council remain fully applicable within the framework of this Directive.
(49) With regard to the purchase of certain products and services and the purchase and rent of buildings, contracting 
authorities and contracting entities which conclude public works, supply or service contracts should lead by 
example and make energy-efficient purchasing decisions and apply the energy efficiency first principle, including 
for those public contracts and concessions for which no specific requirements are provided for in this Directive. 
This should apply to contracting authorities and contracting entities falling within the scope of 
Directives 2014/23/EU, 2014/24/EU or 2014/25/EU. Member States should remove barriers to joint procurement 
within a Member State or across borders if this can reduce the costs and enhance the benefits of the internal market 
by creating business opportunities for suppliers and energy service providers.
(50) All public entities investing public resources through procurement should lead by example when awarding contracts 
and concessions by choosing products, buildings, works and services with the highest energy efficiency 
performance, also in relation to those procurements that are not subject to specific requirements under 
Directive 2009/30/EC. In that context, all award procedures for public contracts and concessions with a value 
above the thresholds set out in Article 8 of Directive 2014/23/EU, Article 4 of Directive 2014/24/EU, and 
Article 15 of Directive 2014/25/EU need to take into account the energy efficiency performance of the products, 
buildings and services set by Union or national law, by considering as priority the energy efficiency first principle in 
their procurement procedures.
(51) It is also important that Member States monitor how the energy efficiency requirements are taken into account by 
contracting authorities and contracting entities in the procurement of products, buildings, works and services by 
ensuring that information about the impact on the energy efficiency of those winning tenders above the thresholds 
referred to in the procurement directives are made publicly available. That would allow stakeholders and citizens to 
assess the role of the public sector in ensuring energy efficiency first in public procurement in a transparent manner.
(52) The obligation for Member States to ensure that contracting authorities and entities purchase only products, 
buildings, works and services with high energy efficiency performance should not, however, prevent Member States 
from purchasing goods necessary to protect, and respond to, public security or public health emergencies.
(53) The European Green Deal recognises the role of the circular economy in contributing to overall Union 
decarbonisation objectives. The public sector and, in particular, the transport sector, should contribute to those 
objectives by using their purchasing power to, where appropriate, choose environmentally friendly products, 
buildings, works and services via available tools for green public procurement, and thus making an important 
contribution to reduce energy consumption and environmental impacts.
(54) It is important that Member States provide the necessary support to public bodies in the uptake of energy efficiency 
requirements in public procurement and, where appropriate, in the use of green public procurement by providing 
necessary guidelines and methodologies on carrying out the assessment of life-cycle costs and environment impacts 
and costs. Well-designed tools, in particular digital tools, are expected to facilitate the procurement procedures and 
reduce the administrative costs especially in smaller Member States that may not have sufficient capacity to prepare 
tenders. In this regard, Member States should actively promote the use of digital tools and cooperation amongst 
contracting authorities including across borders for the purpose of exchanging best practices.

should also consider the whole life cycle of carbon emissions of buildings. That should take place in the context of 
efforts to increase the attention given to whole life-cycle performance, circular economy aspects and environmental impacts, as part of the exemplary role of the public sector. Public procurement can thus serve as an opportunity to 
address the embodied carbon in buildings over their life cycle. In this regard, contracting authorities are important 
actors that can take action as part of procurement procedures by purchasing new buildings that address global warming potential over the full life cycle.
(56) The global warming potential over the full life cycle measures the GHG emissions associated with the building at different stages along its life cycle. It therefore measures the building’s overall contribution to emissions that lead to climate change. That is sometimes referred to as a carbon footprint assessment or the whole life carbon 
measurement. It brings together carbon emissions embodied in building materials with direct and indirect carbon 
emissions from use stage. Buildings are a significant material bank, being repositories for carbon intensive resources over many decades, and so it is important to explore designs that facilitate future reuse and recycling at the end of the operational life in line with the new circular economy action plan. Member States should promote circularity, 
durability, and adaptability of building materials, in order to address the sustainability performance of construction 
products.
(57) The global warming potential is expressed as a numeric indicator in kgCO
2eq/m2 (of useful internal floor area) for 
each life-cycle stage averaged for one year of a reference study period of 50 years. The data selection, scenario definition and calculations are carried out in accordance with standard EN 15978. The scope of building elements 
and technical equipment are set out in indicator 1,2 of the Level(s) common Union framework. Where a national 
calculation tool exists, or is required for making disclosures or for obtaining building permits, it should be possible 
to use that national tool to provide the required information. It should be possible to use other calculation tools, if they fulfil the minimum criteria laid down by the Level(s) common Union framework.
(58) Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (
21)lays down rules on installations that 
contribute to energy production or use energy for production purposes, and provides that information on the energy used in or generated by the installation is to be included in applications for integrated permits in accordance with Article 12(1), point (b) of that Directive. Moreover, Article 11 of that Directive provides that efficient use of 
energy is one of the general principles governing the basic obligations of the operator and one of the criteria for 
determining best available techniques pursuant to Annex III to that Directive. The operational efficiency of energy 
systems at any given moment is influenced by the ability to feed power generated from different sources with 
different degrees of inertia and start-up times into the grid smoothly and flexibly. Improving efficiency will enable 
better use to be made of renewable energy.
(59) Improvement in energy efficiency can contribute to higher economic output. Member States and the Union should aim to decrease energy consumption regardless of levels of economic growth.
(60) The energy savings obligation established by this Directive should be increased and should also apply after 2030. 
That ensures stability for investors and thus encourages long-term investments and long-term energy efficiency 
measures, such as the deep renovation of buildings with the long-term objective of facilitating the cost effective 
transformation of existing buildings into nearly zero-energy buildings. The energy savings obligation plays an important role in the creation of local growth, jobs, competitiveness and alleviating energy poverty. It should ensure that the Union can achieve its energy and climate objectives by creating further opportunities and by 
breaking the link between energy consumption and growth. Cooperation with the private sector is important to 
assess the conditions on which private investment for energy efficiency projects can be unlocked and to develop 
new revenue models for innovation in the field of energy efficiency.
(21)Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 on industrial emissions (integrated 
pollution prevention and control) (OJ L 334, 17.12.2010, p. 17).EN Official Journal of the European Union 20.9.2023 L 231/11  (61) Energy efficiency improvement measures also have a positive impact on air quality, as more energy efficient 
buildings contribute to reducing the demand for heating fuels, including solid heating fuels. Energy efficiency 
measures therefore contribute to improving indoor and outdoor air quality and help achieve, in a cost-effective 
manner, the objectives of the Union’s air quality policy, as laid down in particular by Directive (EU) 2016/2284 of the European Parliament and of the Council (
22).
(62) With a view to ensuring a stable and predictable contribution towards achieving the Union’s energy and climate targets for 2030 and the climate neutrality objective for 2050, Member States are required to achieve cumulative end-use energy savings for the entire obligation period up to 2030, equivalent to new annual savings of at least 0,8 % of final energy consumption up to 31 December 2023 and of at least 1,3 % from 1 January 2024, 1,5 % from 
1 January 2026 and 1,9 % from 1 January 2028. That requirement could be met by new policy measures that are 
adopted during the obligation period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2030 or by new individual actions as a 
result of policy measures adopted during or before the previous period, provided that the individual actions that trigger energy savings are introduced during the following period. To that end, Member States should be able to 
make use of an energy efficiency obligation scheme, alternative policy measures, or both.
(63) For the period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2023, Cyprus and Malta should be required to achieve 
cumulative end-use energy savings equivalent to new savings of 0,24 % of annual final energy consumption 
averaged over the most recent three-year period preceding 1 January 2019. For the period from 1 January 2024
to 31 December 2030, Cyprus and Malta should be required to achieve cumulative end-use energy savings of 
0,45 % of annual final energy consumption, averaged over the most recent three-year period 
preceding 1 January 2019.
(64) Where using an obligation scheme, Member States should designate obligated parties among transmission system 
operators, distribution system operators, energy distributors, retail energy sales companies and transport fuel distributors or transport fuel retailers on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory criteria. The designation or 
exemption from designation of certain categories of such entities should not be understood to be incompatible with 
the principle of non-discrimination. Member States are therefore able to choose whether such entities or only certain 
categories thereof are designated as obligated parties. To empower and protect people affected by energy poverty, 
vulnerable customers, people in low-income households and, where applicable, people living in social housing, and to implement policy measures as a priority among those people, Member States can require obligated parties to 
achieve energy savings among those people. For that purpose, Member States can also establish energy cost 
reduction targets. Obligated parties could achieve those targets by promoting the installation of measures that lead to energy savings and financial savings on energy bills, such as the installation of insulation and heating measures, and by supporting energy savings initiatives by renewable energy communities and citizen energy communities.
(65) When designing policy measures to fulfil the energy savings obligation, Member States should respect the climate 
and environmental standards and priorities of the Union and comply with the principle of ‘do no significant harm’ 
within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2020/852. Member States should not promote activities that are not environmentally sustainable such as the use of fossil fuels. The energy savings obligation aims at strengthening the response to climate change by promoting incentives to Member States to implement a sustainable and clean policy 
mix, which is resilient, and mitigates climate change. Therefore, energy savings from policy measures regarding the 
use of direct fossil fuel combustion may be eligible energy savings under the energy savings obligation under certain conditions and for a transitional period following the transposition of this Directive in accordance with an annex to this Directive. It will allow aligning the energy savings obligation with the objectives of the European Green Deal, the 
Climate Target Plan, the Renovation Wave, and mirror the need for action identified by the International Energy 
Agency in its net zero report. The restriction aims at encouraging Member States to spend public money into future-proof, sustainable technologies only. It is important that Member States provide a clear policy framework and investment certainty to market actors. The implementation of the calculation methodology under the energy 
(22)Directive (EU) 2016/2284 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2016 on the reduction of national 
emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants, amending Directive 2003/35/EC and repealing Directive 2001/81/EC (OJ L 344, 
17.12.2016, p. 1).EN Official Journal of the European Union L 231/12 20.9.2023  savings obligation should allow all market actors to adapt their technologies in a reasonable timeframe. Where 
Member States support the uptake of efficient fossil fuel technologies or early replacement of such technology, for 
example through subsidy schemes or energy efficiency obligation schemes, any resulting energy savings may no 
longer be eligible under the energy savings obligation. While energy savings resulting, for example, from the 
promotion of natural gas-based cogeneration would not be eligible under the energy savings obligation, the 
restriction would not apply for indirect fossil fuel usage, for example where the electricity production includes fossil 
fuel generation. Policy measures targeting behavioural changes to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels, for example through information campaigns and eco-driving, should remain eligible. Policy measures which target building 
renovations may include measures such as the replacement of fossil fuel heating systems together with building 
fabric improvements. Those measures should be limited to technologies that allow the required energy savings to be 
achieved in accordance with the national building codes established in a Member State. Nevertheless, Member States 
should promote upgrading heating systems as part of deep renovations in line with the long-term objective of 
carbon neutrality, namely reducing the heating demand and covering the remaining heating demand with a carbon- 
free energy source. When accounting for the savings needed to achieve a share of the energy savings obligation among people affected by energy poverty, Member States may take into account their climatic conditions.
(66) Member States’ energy efficiency improvement measures in transport are eligible to be taken into account for achieving their end-use energy savings obligation. Such measures include policies that are, inter alia, dedicated to 
promoting more efficient vehicles, a modal shift to cycling, walking and collective transport, or mobility and urban 
planning that reduces demand for transport. In addition, schemes which accelerate the uptake of new, more efficient vehicles or policy measures which foster a shift to fuels with reduced levels of emissions, except schemes or 
policy measures regarding the use of direct fossil fuel combustion that reduce energy use per kilometre, are also 
capable of being eligible, subject to compliance with the rules on materiality and additionality set out in this 
Directive. Policy measures promoting the uptake of new fossil fuel vehicles should not qualify as eligible measures 
under the energy savings obligation.
(67) Measures taken by Member States pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/842 of the European Parliament and of the 
Council (
23)and which result in verifiable and measurable or estimable energy efficiency improvements can be 
considered to be a cost-effective way for Member States to fulfil their energy savings obligation under this Directive.
(68) As an alternative to requiring obligated parties to achieve the amount of cumulative end-use energy savings required 
under the energy savings obligation laid down in this Directive, it should be possible for Member States, in their obligation schemes, to permit or require obligated parties to contribute to a national energy efficiency fund, which 
could be used to implement policy measures as a priority among people affected by energy poverty, vulnerable 
customers, people in low income households and, where applicable, people living in social housing.
(69) Member States and obligated parties should make use of all available means and technologies, except with regard to 
the use of direct fossil fuel combustion technologies, to achieve the cumulative end-use energy savings required, including by promoting smart and sustainable technologies in efficient district heating and cooling systems, 
efficient heating and cooling infrastructure, efficient and smart buildings, electrical vehicles and industries and 
energy audits or equivalent management systems, provided that the energy savings claimed comply with this 
Directive. Member States should aim for a high degree of flexibility in the design and implementation of alternative 
policy measures. Member States should encourage actions resulting in energy savings over a long lifetime.
(23)Regulation (EU) 2018/842 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 on binding annual greenhouse gas 
emission reductions by Member States from 2021 to 2030 contributing to climate action to meet commitments under the Paris 
Agreement and amending Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 (OJ L 156, 19.6.2018, p. 26).EN Official Journal of the European Union 20.9.2023 L 231/13  (70) Long-term energy efficiency measures continue to deliver energy savings after 2020 but, in order to contribute to the 
Union’s 2030 energy efficiency target, those measures should deliver new savings after 2020. On the other hand, 
energy savings achieved after 31 December 2020 should not count towards the cumulative end-use energy savings 
required for the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020.
(71) Additionality is a fundamental underlying principle of the energy savings obligation provided for in this Directive, in so far as it ensures that Member States put in place policies and measures specifically designed for the purpose of fulfilling the energy savings obligation. New savings should be additional to ‘business as usual’, so that savings that 
would have occurred in any event should not count towards fulfilling the energy savings obligation. In order to 
calculate the impact of the measures introduced, only net savings, measured as the change of energy consumption that is directly attributable to the energy efficiency measure in question implemented for the purpose of the energy 
savings obligation provided for in this Directive, should be counted. To calculate net savings, Member States should 
establish a baseline scenario of how the situation would evolve in the absence of the measure in question. The 
policy measure in question should be evaluated against that baseline. Member States should take into account minimum requirements provided by the relevant legislative framework at Union level and the fact that other policy 
measures may be carried out in the same time frame which may also have an impact on the amount of energy 
savings, so that not all changes observed since the introduction of a particular policy measure can be attributed to that policy measure alone. The actions of the obligated, participating or entrusted party should in fact contribute to the achievement of the energy savings claimed in order to ensure the fulfilment of the materiality requirement.
(72) It is important to consider, where relevant, all steps in the energy chain in the calculation of energy savings in order to increase the energy savings potential in the transmission and distribution of electricity. Studies and the 
consultation of stakeholders have revealed a significant potential. However, the physical and economic conditions 
are quite different among Member States, and often within several Member States, and there is a large number of 
system operators. Those circumstances point to a decentralised approach, pursuant to the subsidiarity principle. 
National Regulatory Authorities have the required knowledge, legal competences and the administrative capacity to 
promote the development of an energy efficient electricity grid. Entities such as the European Network of 
Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) and the European Entity for Distribution System Operators can also provide useful contributions to, and should support their members in, the uptake of energy efficiency measures.
(73) Similar considerations apply for the very large number of natural gas system operators. The role of natural gas and the rate of supply and coverage of the territory is highly variable among Member States. In those cases, National 
Regulatory Authorities are best placed to monitor and steer the system evolution towards an increased efficiency, 
and entities such as the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas can provide useful contributions to, and should support their members in, the uptake of energy efficiency measures.
(74) The role of ESCOs is important in developing, designing, building, and arranging financing for projects that save energy, reduce energy costs, and decrease operations and maintenance costs in sectors such as buildings, industry and transport.
(75) Consideration of the water-energy nexus is particularly important to address the interdependent use of energy and water and the increasing pressure on both resources. The effective management of water can make a significant 
contribution to energy savings yielding not only climate benefits, but also economic and social benefits. The water 
and wastewater sectors account for 3,5 % of electricity use in the Union and that share is expected to rise. At the same time, water leaks account for 24 % of total water consumed in the Union and the energy sector is the largest 
consumer of water, accounting for 44 % of consumption. The potential for energy savings through the use of smart 
technologies and processes across all industrial, residential and commercial water cycles and applications should be 
fully explored and realised whenever cost-effective, and the energy efficiency first principle should be considered. In addition, advanced irrigation technologies, rainwater harvesting and water reuse technologies could substantially 
reduce water consumption in agriculture, buildings and industry and the energy used for treating and transporting it.EN Official Journal of the European Union L 231/14 20.9.2023  (76) In accordance with Article 9 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Union’s energy 
efficiency policies should be inclusive and should therefore ensure equal access to energy efficiency measures for all 
consumers affected by energy poverty. Improvements in energy efficiency should be implemented as a priority among people affected by energy poverty, vulnerable customers and final users, people in low-income or medium- 
income households, people living in social housing, older people as well as people living in rural and remote areas 
and in the outermost regions. In that context, specific attention should be paid to particular groups which are more 
at risk of being affected by energy poverty or are more susceptible to the adverse impacts of energy poverty, such as 
women, persons with disabilities, older people, children, and people with a minority racial or ethnic background. 
Member States can require obligated parties to include social aims in energy-saving measures in relation to energy 
poverty, and this possibility has already been extended to alternative policy measures and national energy efficiency funds. That should be transformed into an obligation to protect and empower vulnerable customers and final users 
and to alleviate energy poverty, while allowing Member States to retain full flexibility with regard to the type of 
policy measure, its size, scope and content. If an energy efficiency obligation scheme does not permit measures 
relating to individual energy consumers, the Member State may take measures to alleviate energy poverty by means of alternative policy measures alone. Within their policy mix, Member States should ensure that other policy measures do not have an adverse effect on people affected by energy poverty vulnerable customers, final users and, 
where applicable, people living in social housing. Member States should make best possible use of public funding 
investments into energy efficiency improvement measures, including funding and financial facilities established at 
Union level.
(77) Each Member State should define the concept of vulnerable customers, which may refer to energy poverty and, inter alia, to the prohibition of disconnection of electricity to such customers in critical times. The concept of vulnerable 
customers may include income levels, the share of energy expenditure of disposable income, the energy efficiency of 
homes, critical dependence on electrical equipment for health reasons, age or other criteria. This allows Member 
States to include people in low-income households.
(78) According to Recommendation (EU) 2020/1563, around 34 million households in the Union were unable to keep 
their home adequately warm in 2019. The European Green Deal prioritises the social dimension of the transition 
by committing to the principle that ‘no one is left behind’. The green transition, including the clean transition, 
affects women and men differently and may have a particular impact on some disadvantaged groups including 
people with disabilities. Energy efficiency measures must therefore be central to any cost-effective strategy to address energy poverty and consumer vulnerability and are complementary to social security policies at Member State level. To ensure that energy efficiency measures reduce energy poverty for tenants sustainably, the cost- 
effectiveness of such measures, as well as their affordability to property owners and tenants, should be taken into 
account, and adequate financial and technical support for such measures should be guaranteed at Member State level. Member States should support the local and regional level in identifying and alleviating energy poverty. The 
Union’s building stock needs, in the long term, to be converted to nearly zero-energy buildings in accordance with 
the objectives of the Paris Agreement. Current building renovation rates are insufficient and buildings occupied by citizens on low incomes who are affected by energy poverty are the hardest to reach. The measures laid down in 
this Directive with regard to energy savings obligations, energy efficiency obligation schemes and alternative policy 
measures are therefore of particular importance.
(79) Member States should strive to ensure that measures to promote or facilitate energy efficiency, in particular those 
concerning buildings and mobility, do not lead to a disproportionate increase in the cost of services relating to such 
measures or to greater social exclusion.
(80) To tap the energy savings potential in certain market segments where energy audits are generally not offered 
commercially, such as small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), Member States should develop programmes to encourage and support SMEs to undergo energy audits and to implement the recommendations arising from those energy audits. Energy audits should be mandatory and regular for enterprises with an average annual energy 
consumption above a certain threshold, as energy savings can be significant. Energy audits should take into account 
relevant European or international standards, such as EN ISO 50001 (Energy Management Systems), or EN 16247-1 (Energy Audits), or, if including an energy audit, EN ISO 14000 (Environmental Management Systems) and thus be 
also in accordance with this Directive, which does not go beyond the requirements of those relevant standards. A EN Official Journal of the European Union 20.9.2023 L 231/15  specific European standard on energy audits is currently under development. Energy audits may be carried out on a 
stand-alone basis or be part of a broader environmental management system or an energy performance contract. In 
all such cases those systems should comply with the minimum requirements laid down in this Directive. In addition, specific mechanisms and schemes established to monitor emissions and fuel consumption by certain transport 
operators, for example under Union law the EU ETS, may be considered compatible with energy audits, including in 
energy management systems, if they comply with the minimum requirements laid down in this Directive. For those enterprises already implementing the energy audit obligation, energy audits should continue to be carried out at least every four years from the date of the previous energy audit, in accordance with this Directive.
(81) Member States could establish guidelines for enterprises to follow in implementing measures to achieve new annual savings identified in the energy audit.
(82) The enterprise’s average consumption should be the criterion to define the application of energy management systems and of energy audits in order to increase the sensitivity of those mechanisms in identifying relevant 
opportunities for cost-effective energy savings. An enterprise that is below the consumption thresholds defined for 
energy management systems and energy audits should be encouraged to undergo energy audits and to implement the recommendations resulting from those audits.
(83) Where energy audits are carried out by in-house experts, they should not be directly engaged in the activity audited in order to guarantee their independence.
(84) Member States should promote the implementation of energy management systems and energy audits within the public administration at national, regional and local level.
(85) The ICT sector is another important sector which receives increasing attention. In 2018 the energy consumption of data centres in the Union was 76,8 TWh. This is expected to rise to 98,5 TWh by 2030, a 28 % increase. This increase in absolute terms can also be seen in relative terms: within the Union, data centres accounted for 2,7 % of electricity demand in 2018 and will reach 3,21 % by 2030 if development continues on the current trajectory. The 
Union’s Digital Strategy already highlighted the need for highly energy-efficient and sustainable data centres and 
calls for transparency measures for telecommunication operators on their environmental footprint. To promote sustainable development in the ICT sector, particularly of data centres, Member States should require the collection and publication of data which are relevant for the energy performance, water footprint and demand-side flexibility 
of data centres, on the basis of a common Union template. Member States should require the collection and 
publication of data only about data centres with a significant footprint, for which appropriate design or efficiency interventions, for new or existing installations respectively, can result in a considerable reduction of energy and 
water consumption, an increase in systems’ efficiency promoting decarbonisation of the grid or in the reuse of 
waste heat in nearby facilities and heat networks. Data centre sustainability indicators could be established on the basis of that data collected, taking also into account already existing initiatives in the sector.
(86) The reporting obligation applies to those data centres, which meet the threshold set out in this Directive. In all cases 
and specifically for onsite enterprise data centres, the reporting obligation should be understood as referring to the 
spaces and equipment that serve primarily or exclusively for data-related functions (server rooms), including the necessary associated equipment, for example, associated cooling, lighting, battery arrays, or uninterruptible power 
supplies. Any IT equipment placed or installed in primarily public access, common use or office space or 
supporting other corporate functions, such as workstations, laptops, photocopiers, sensors, security equipment, or 
white goods and audiovisual appliances should be excluded from the reporting obligation. The same exclusion should also apply to server, networking, storage, and associated equipment that would be scattered across a site 
such as single servers, single racks, or Wi-Fi and networking points.EN Official Journal of the European Union L 231/16 20.9.2023  (87) The collected data should be used to measure at least some basic dimensions of a sustainable data centre, namely 
how efficiently it uses energy, how much of that energy comes from renewable energy sources, the reuse of any 
waste heat that it produces, the effectiveness of cooling, the effectiveness of carbon usage and the usage of 
freshwater. The collected data and the sustainability indicators should raise awareness among data centre owners 
and operators, manufacturers of equipment, developers of software and services, users of data centre services at all 
levels as well as entities and organisations that deploy, use or procure cloud and data centre services. The collected 
data and the sustainability indicators should also give confidence about the actual improvements following efforts 
and measures to increase the sustainability in new or existing data centres. Finally, those data and indicators should 
be used as a basis for transparent and evidence-based planning and decision making. The Commission should assess the efficiency of data centres on the basis of the information communicated by the obligated data centres.
(88) Following an assessment, when establishing the possible sector-specific energy efficiency partnerships, the Commission should bring together key stakeholders, including non-governmental organisations and the social 
partners, in sectors such as ICT, transport, finance and buildings in an inclusive and representative manner.
(89) Lower consumer spending on energy should be achieved by assisting consumers in reducing their energy use by 
reducing the energy needs of buildings and improvements in the efficiency of appliances, which should be 
combined with the availability of low-energy transport modes integrated with public transport, shared mobility and 
cycling. Member States should also consider improving connectivity in rural and remote areas.
(90) It is crucial to raise the awareness of all Union citizens about the benefits of increased energy efficiency and to provide them with accurate information on the ways in which it can be achieved. Citizens of all ages should also be 
involved in the energy transition via the European Climate Pact and the Conference on the Future of Europe. 
Increased energy efficiency is also highly important for the security of energy supply of the Union through lowering 
its dependence on import of fuels from third countries.
(91) The costs and benefits of all energy efficiency measures taken, including pay-back periods, should be made fully 
transparent to consumers.
(92) When implementing this Directive and taking other measures in the field of energy efficiency, Member States should 
pay particular attention to synergies between energy efficiency measures and the efficient use of natural resources in 
line with the principles of the circular economy.
(93) Taking advantage of new business models and technologies, Member States should endeavour to promote and 
facilitate the uptake of energy efficiency measures, including through innovative energy services for large and small 
customers.
(94) It is necessary to provide for frequent and enhanced feedback on energy consumption where technically feasible and 
cost-efficient in view of the measurement devices in place. This Directive clarifies that the cost-efficiency of sub- 
metering depends on whether the related costs are proportionate to the potential energy savings. The assessment of 
whether sub-metering is cost-efficient may take into account the effect of other concrete, planned measures in a 
given building, such as any forthcoming renovation.
(95) This Directive also clarifies that rights relating to billing, and information about billing or consumption should apply 
to consumers of heating, cooling or domestic hot water supplied from a central source even where they have no 
direct, individual contractual relationship with an energy supplier.EN Official Journal of the European Union 20.9.2023 L 231/17  (96) In order to achieve the transparency of accounting for individual consumption of thermal energy, and thereby 
facilitate the implementation of sub-metering, Member States should ensure they have in place transparent, publicly 
available national rules on the allocation of the cost of heating, cooling and domestic hot water consumption in 
multi-apartment and multi-purpose buildings. In addition to transparency, Member States could consider taking 
measures to strengthen competition in the provision of sub-metering services and thereby help ensure that any 
costs borne by the final users are reasonable.
(97) Newly installed heat meters and heat cost allocators should be remotely readable to ensure cost-effective, and 
frequent provision of, consumption information. The provisions of this Directive relating to metering for heating, 
cooling and domestic hot water; sub-metering and cost allocation for heating, cooling and domestic hot water; 
remote reading requirement; billing and consumption information for heating and cooling and domestic hot water; 
the cost of access to metering and billing and consumption information for heating, cooling and domestic hot water; and the minimum requirements for billing and consumption information for heating, cooling and domestic 
hot water, are intended to apply only to heating, cooling and domestic hot water supplied from a central source. 
Member States are free to decide whether walk-by or drive-by technologies are to be considered remotely readable 
or not. Remotely readable devices do not require access to individual apartments or units to be read.
(98) Member States should take into account the fact that the successful implementation of new technologies for 
measuring energy consumption requires enhanced investment in education and skills for both users and energy 
suppliers.
(99) Billing information and annual statements are an important means by which customers are informed of their energy 
consumption. Data on consumption and costs can also convey other information that helps consumers to compare 
their current deal with other offers and to make use of complaint-management and alternative dispute-resolution mechanisms. However, considering that bill-related disputes are a common source of consumer complaints and a 
factor which contributes to persistently low levels of consumer satisfaction and engagement with their energy 
providers, it is necessary to make bills simpler, clearer and easier to understand, while ensuring that separate 
instruments, such as billing information, information tools and annual statements, provide all the necessary 
information to enable consumers to regulate their energy consumption, compare offers and switch suppliers.
(100) When designing energy efficiency improvement measures, Member States should take due account of the need to ensure the correct functioning of the internal market and the consistent implementation of the acquis, in accordance 
with the TFEU.
(101) High-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling have significant potential for saving primary energy in the Union. Member States should carry out a comprehensive assessment of the potential for high- 
efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling. Those assessments should be consistent with 
Member States’ integrated national energy and climate plans and their long-term renovation strategies, and could 
include trajectories leading to a renewable energy and waste heat based national heating and cooling sector within a 
timeframe compatible with the achievement of the climate neutrality objective. New electricity generation 
installations and existing installations which are substantially refurbished or whose permit or licence is updated 
should, subject to a cost-benefit analysis showing a cost-benefit surplus, be equipped with high-efficiency 
cogeneration units to recover waste heat stemming from the production of electricity. Similarly, other facilities with 
substantial annual average energy input should be equipped with technical solutions to deploy waste heat from the 
facility where the cost-benefit analysis shows a cost-benefit surplus. This waste heat could be transported where it is 
needed through district heating networks. The events that trigger a requirement for authorisation criteria to be 
applied will generally be such as to also trigger requirements for permits under Directive 2010/75/EU and for 
authorisation under Directive (EU) 2019/944.EN Official Journal of the European Union L 231/18 20.9.2023  (102) It may be appropriate for electricity generation installations that are intended to make use of geological storage 
permitted under Directive 2009/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (24)to be located in places 
where the recovery of waste heat, through high-efficiency cogeneration or by supplying a district heating or cooling 
network, is not cost-effective. Member States should therefore be able to exempt those installations from the obligation to carry out a cost-benefit analysis for providing the installation with equipment allowing the recovery of 
waste heat by means of a high-efficiency cogeneration unit. It should also be possible to exempt peak-load and 
back-up electricity generation installations which are planned to operate under 1 500 operating hours per year as a 
rolling average over a period of five years from the requirement to also provide heat.
(103) It is appropriate for Member States to encourage the introduction of measures and procedures to promote cogeneration installations with a total rated thermal input of less than 5 MW in order to encourage distributed energy generation.
(104) To implement national comprehensive assessments, Member States should encourage the assessments of the potential for high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling at regional and local level. Member States should take steps to promote and facilitate the realisation of the identified cost-efficient potential of high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling.
(105) Requirements for efficient district heating and cooling should be consistent with long-term climate policy goals, the climate and environmental standards and the priorities of the Union, and should comply with the principle of ‘do no 
significant harm’ within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2020/852. All the district heating and cooling systems 
should aim for improved ability to interact with other parts of the energy system in order to optimise the use of energy and prevent energy waste by using the full potential of buildings to store heat or cold, including the excess heat from service facilities and nearby data centres. For that reason, efficient district heating and cooling systems 
should ensure the increase of primary energy efficiency and a progressive integration of renewable energy and waste 
heat and cold as defined in Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (
25). Therefore, 
this Directive introduces progressively stricter requirements for heating and cooling supply which should be applicable during specific established time periods and should be permanently applicable from 1 January 2050 onwards.
(106) The principles to calculate the share of the heat or cold from renewable energy sources in efficient district heating and cooling should be consistent with Directive (EU) 2018/2001 and Eurostat methodologies for statistical reporting. Pursuant to Article 7(1) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, the gross final consumption of energy from 
renewable sources includes gross final consumption of energy from renewable sources in the heating and cooling 
sector. A gross final energy consumption of heat or cold in district heating or cooling equals heat or cold energy supply going into the network serving the final customers or energy distributors.
(107) Heat pumps are important for the decarbonisation of the heating and cooling supply, also in district heating. The methodology established in Annex VII to Directive (EU) 2018/2001 provides rules to count energy captured by heat pumps as energy from renewable sources and prevents double counting of the electricity from renewable sources. For the purposes of calculating the share of renewable energy in a district heating network, all the heat originating 
from the heat pump and going into the network should be accounted as renewable energy, provided that the heat 
pump meets the minimum efficiency criteria set out in Annex VII to Directive (EU) 2018/2001 at the time of its 
installation.

and amending Council Directive 85/337/EEC, European Parliament and Council Directives 2000/60/EC, 2001/80/EC, 2004/35/EC, 
2006/12/EC, 2008/1/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 (OJ L 140, 5.6.2009, p. 114).
(25)Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the promotion of the use of 
energy from renewable sources (OJ L 328, 21.12.2018, p. 82).EN Official Journal of the European Union 20.9.2023 L 231/19  (108) High-efficiency cogeneration has been defined by the energy savings obtained by combined production instead of 
separate production of heat and electricity. Requirements for high-efficiency cogeneration should be consistent with 
long-term climate policy goals. The definitions of cogeneration and high-efficiency cogeneration used in Union legislation should be without prejudice to the use of different definitions in national legislation for purposes other 
than those of the Union legislation in question. To maximise energy savings and avoid energy saving opportunities 
being missed, the greatest attention should be paid to the operating conditions of cogeneration units.
(109) To ensure transparency and allow the final customer to choose between electricity from cogeneration and electricity produced by other techniques, the origin of high-efficiency cogeneration should be guaranteed on the basis of harmonised efficiency reference values. Guarantee of origin schemes do not of themselves imply a right to benefit 
from national support mechanisms. It is important that all forms of electricity produced from high-efficiency 
cogeneration can be covered by guarantees of origin. Guarantees of origin should be distinguished from exchangeable certificates.
(110) The specific structure of the cogeneration and district heating and cooling sectors, which include many producers that are SMEs, should be taken into account, especially when reviewing the administrative procedures for obtaining permission to construct cogeneration capacity or associated networks, in application of the ‘think small first’ 
principle.
(111) Most Union businesses are SMEs. They represent an enormous energy saving potential for the Union. To help them 
adopt energy efficiency measures, Member States should establish a favourable framework aimed at providing SMEs 
with technical assistance and targeted information.
(112) Member States should establish, on the basis of objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria, rules governing the bearing and sharing of costs of grid connections and grid reinforcements and rules for technical 
adaptations needed to integrate new producers of electricity produced from high-efficiency cogeneration, taking 
into account network codes and guidelines developed in accordance with Regulations (EU) 2019/943 (
26)and (EC) 
No 715/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (27). Producers of electricity generated from high- 
efficiency cogeneration should be allowed to issue a call for tender for the connection work. Access to the grid 
system for electricity produced from high-efficiency cogeneration, especially for small scale and micro-cogeneration 
units, should be facilitated. In accordance with Article 3(2) of Directive 2009/73/EC and Article 9(2) of Directive 
(EU) 2019/944, it is possible for Member States to impose public service obligations, including in relation to energy efficiency, on enterprises operating in the electricity and gas sectors.
(113) It is necessary to set out provisions relating to billing, single point of contact, out-of-court dispute settlement, energy poverty and basic contractual rights, with the aim of aligning them, where appropriate, with the relevant provisions regarding electricity pursuant to Directive (EU) 2019/944, in order to strengthen consumer protection and enable 
final customers to receive more frequent, clear and up-to-date information about their heating, cooling or domestic 
hot water consumption and to regulate their energy use.
(114) This Directive strengthens the protection of consumers by introducing basic contractual rights for district heating, 
cooling and domestic hot water, coherent with the level of rights, protection and empowerment that Directive 
(EU) 2019/944 has introduced for final customers in the electricity sector. Plain and unambiguous information concerning their rights should be made available to consumers. Several factors impede consumers from accessing, 
understanding and acting upon the various sources of market information available to them. The introduction of 
basic contractual rights can help, among others, with a proper understanding of the baseline of the quality of 
services offered in the contract by the supplier, including the quality and characteristics of the supplied energy. In 
addition, it can contribute to the minimisation of hidden or extra costs that could result from the introduction of 
(26)Regulation (EU) 2019/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on the internal market for electricity 
(OJ L 158, 14.6.2019, p. 54).
(27)Regulation (EC) No 715/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on conditions for access to the natural gas transmission networks and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1775/2005 (OJ L 211, 14.8.2009, p. 36).EN Official Journal of the European Union L 231/20 20.9.2023  either upgraded or new services after the signing of the contract without a clear understanding and agreement by the 
customer. Those services could concern, among others, the energy supplied, metering and billing services, purchase 
and installation or ancillary and maintenance services and costs relating to the network, metering devices, local 
heating or cooling equipment. The requirements will contribute to the improvement of comparability of offers and 
ensure the same level of basic contractual rights for all Union citizens regarding heating, cooling and domestic hot 
water, without restricting national competences.
(115) In the case of planned disconnection from heating, cooling and domestic hot water, suppliers should provide the 
customers concerned with adequate information on alternative measures, such as sources of support to avoid 
disconnection, prepayment systems, energy audits, energy consultancy services, alternative payment plans, debt 
management advice or disconnection moratoria.
(116) Greater consumer protection should be guaranteed through the availability of effective, independent out-of-court dispute settlement mechanisms for all consumers, such as an energy ombudsperson, a consumer body or a 
regulatory authority. Member States should, therefore, introduce speedy and effective complaint-handling 
procedures.
(117) The contribution of renewable energy communities, pursuant to Directive (EU) 2018/2001, and citizen energy communities, pursuant to Directive (EU) 2019/944, towards the objectives of the European Green Deal and the 
Climate Target Plan, should be recognised and actively supported. Member States should, therefore, consider and 
promote the role of renewable energy communities and citizen energy communities. Those communities can help 
Member States to achieve the objectives of this Directive by advancing energy efficiency at local or household level, 
as well as in public buildings, in cooperation with local authorities. They can empower and engage consumers and 
enable certain groups of household customers, including in rural and remote areas, to participate in energy 
efficiency projects and interventions that can combine actions with investment in renewable energy. Energy 
communities can have a strong role to play in educating and increasing citizens’ awareness of measures designed to 
achieve energy savings. If properly supported by Member States, energy communities can help fighting energy 
poverty through the facilitation of energy efficiency projects, reduced energy consumption and lower supply tariffs.
(118) Long-term behavioural changes in energy consumption can be achieved through the empowerment of citizens. 
Energy communities can help deliver long-term energy savings, particularly among households, and an increase in 
sustainable investments from citizens and small businesses. Member States should empower such actions by citizens 
through support for community energy projects and organisations. In addition, engagement strategies, involving all 
relevant stakeholders at national and local level in the policy-making process, can be part of the local or regional 
decarbonisation plans or national buildings renovation plans, with the objective of increasing awareness, obtaining 
feedback on policies and improving their acceptance by the public.
(119) The contribution of one-stop shops or similar structures as mechanisms that can enable multiple target groups, 
including citizens, SMEs and public authorities, to design and implement projects and measures relating to the clean 
energy transition should be recognised. The contribution of one-stop shops can be very important for vulnerable customers, as they could receive reliable and accessible information about energy efficiency improvements. That 
contribution can include the provision of technical, administrative and financial advice and assistance, the 
facilitation of the necessary administrative procedures or of access to financial markets, guidance with regard to the 
Union and national legal frameworks, including public procurement rules and criteria, and the EU taxonomy.
(120) The Commission should review the impact of its measures to support the development of platforms or fora, 
involving, inter alia, the European social dialogue bodies, on fostering training programmes for energy efficiency, 
and should propose further measures where appropriate. The Commission should also encourage the European 
social partners in their discussions on energy efficiency, especially for vulnerable customers and final users, 
including those in energy poverty.EN Official Journal of the European Union 20.9.2023 L 231/21  (121) A fair transition towards a climate-neutral Union by 2050 is central to the European Green Deal. The European Pillar 
of Social Rights, jointly proclaimed by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on 17 November 
2017, includes energy among the essential services that everyone is entitled to access. Support for access to such 
services must be available for those in need, particularly in a context of inflationary pressure and significant 
increases in energy prices.
(122) It is necessary to ensure that people affected by energy poverty, vulnerable customers, people in low-income 
households and, where applicable, people living in social housing are protected and, to that end, empowered to 
actively participate in the energy efficiency improvement interventions, measures and related consumer protection 
or information measures that Member States implement. Targeted awareness-raising campaigns should be 
developed to illustrate the benefits of energy efficiency as well to provide information on the financial support 
available.
(123) Public funding available at Union and national level should be strategically invested into energy efficiency 
improvement measures, in particular for the benefit of people affected by energy poverty, vulnerable customers, 
people in low-income households and, where applicable, people living in social housing. Member States should take 
advantage of any financial contribution they might receive from the Social Climate Fund established by Regulation 
(EU) 2023/955 of the European Parliament and of the Council (28), and of revenues from allowances from the EU 
ETS. Those revenues will support Member States in fulfilling their obligation to implement energy efficiency 
measures and policy measures under the energy savings obligation as a priority among people affected by energy 
poverty, vulnerable customers, people in low-income households and, where applicable, people living in social 
housing including those living in rural and remote regions.
(124) National funding schemes should be complemented by suitable schemes of better information, technical and 
administrative assistance, and easier access to finance that will enable the best use of the available funds especially 
by people affected by energy poverty, vulnerable customers, people in low-income households and, where 
applicable, people living in social housing.
(125) Member States should empower and protect all people equally, irrespective of sex, gender, age, disability, race or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, religion or belief, and ensure that those most affected, those put at greater risk of 
being affected by energy poverty, or those most exposed to the adverse impacts of energy poverty are adequately 
protected. In addition, Member States should ensure that energy efficiency measures do not exacerbate any existing 
inequalities, in particular with respect to energy poverty.
(126) Pursuant to Article 15(2) of Directive 2012/27/EU, all Member States have undertaken an assessment of the energy 
efficiency potential of their gas and electricity infrastructure, and have identified concrete measures and investments 
for the introduction of cost-effective energy efficiency improvements in the network infrastructure, with a timetable 
for their introduction. The results of those actions represent a solid basis for the application of the energy efficiency 
first principle in their network planning, network development and investment decisions.
(127) National energy regulatory authorities should take an integrated approach encompassing potential savings in the 
energy supply and the end-use sectors. Without prejudice to security of supply, market integration and anticipatory 
investments in offshore grids necessary for the deployment of offshore renewable energy, national energy 
regulatory authorities should ensure that the energy efficiency first principle is applied in the planning and decision- 
making processes and that network tariffs and regulations incentivise improvements in energy efficiency. Member 
States should also ensure that transmission and distribution system operators consider the energy efficiency first 
principle. That would help transmission and distribution system operators to consider better energy efficiency 
solutions for and incremental costs incurred from the procurement of demand-side resources, as well as the 
(28)Regulation (EU) 2023/955 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 May 2023 establishing a Social Climate Fund and 
amending Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 (OJ L 130, 16.5.2023, p. 1).EN Official Journal of the European Union L 231/22 20.9.2023  environmental and socio-economic impacts of different network investments and operation plans. Such an 
approach requires a shift from the narrow economic efficiency perspective to maximised social welfare. The energy 
efficiency first principle should in particular be applied in the context of scenario building for energy infrastructure 
expansion where demand-side solutions could be considered as viable alternatives and need to be properly assessed, 
and should become an intrinsic part of the assessment of network planning projects. Its application should be 
scrutinised by national regulatory authorities.
(128) A sufficient number of reliable professionals competent in the field of energy efficiency should be available to ensure 
the effective and timely implementation of this Directive, for instance as regards compliance with the requirements 
on energy audits and implementation of energy efficiency obligation schemes. Member States should therefore put 
in place certification or equivalent qualification, or both, and suitable training schemes for the providers of energy 
services, energy audits and other energy efficiency improvement measures in close cooperation with the social 
partners, training providers and other relevant stakeholders. The schemes should be assessed every four years 
starting as of December 2024 and, if needed, be updated to ensure the necessary level of competences for energy 
services providers, energy auditors, energy managers and installers of building elements.
(129) It is necessary to continue developing the market for energy services to ensure the availability of both the demand for 
and the supply of energy services. Transparency, for example by means of lists of certified energy services providers 
and available model contracts, exchange of best practices and guidelines greatly contribute to the uptake of energy 
services and energy performance contracting and can also help stimulate demand and increase the trust in energy 
services providers. In an energy performance contract the beneficiary of the energy service avoids investment costs 
by using part of the financial value of energy savings to fully or partially repay the investment carried out by a third 
party. That can help attract private capital which is key for increasing building renovation rates in the Union, bring 
expertise into the market and create innovative business models. Therefore, non-residential buildings with the 
useful floor area above 750 m2 should be required to assess the feasibility of using energy performance contracting 
for renovation. That is a step ahead to increase the trust in energy services companies and pave the way for 
increasing such projects in the future.
(130) Given the ambitious renovation objectives over the next decade in the context of the Renovation Wave, it is 
necessary to increase the role of independent market intermediaries including one-stop shops or similar support 
mechanisms in order to stimulate market development on the demand and supply sides and to promote energy 
performance contracting for renovation of both private and public buildings. Local energy agencies could play a key 
role in that regard, and identify and support setting up potential facilitators or one-stop shops. This Directive should 
help improve the availability of products, services and advice, including by promoting the potential for 
entrepreneurs to fill the gaps in the market and to provide for innovative ways to enhance energy efficiency, while 
ensuring respect for the principle of non-discrimination.
(131) Energy performance contracting still faces important barriers in several Member States due to remaining regulatory 
and non-regulatory barriers. It is therefore necessary to address the ambiguities of the national legislative 
frameworks, lack of expertise, especially as regards tendering procedures, and competing loans and grants.
(132) Member States should continue supporting the public sector in the uptake of energy performance contracting by 
providing model contracts that take into account the available European or international standards, tendering 
guidelines and the Guide to the Statistical Treatment of Energy Performance Contracts published in May 2018 by 
Eurostat and the European Investment Bank (EIB) on the treatment of energy performance contracting in 
government accounts, which have provided opportunities for addressing remaining regulatory barriers to those 
contracts in Member States.EN Official Journal of the European Union 20.9.2023 L 231/23  (133) Member States have taken measures to identify and address regulatory and non-regulatory barriers. However, there is 
a need to increase the effort to remove regulatory and non-regulatory barriers to the use of energy performance 
contracting and third-party financing arrangements which help achieve energy savings. Those barriers include 
accounting rules and practices that prevent capital investments and annual financial savings resulting from energy 
efficiency improvement measures from being adequately reflected in the accounts for the whole life of the 
investment.
(134) Member States used the 2014 and 2017 national energy efficiency action plans to report progress in removing 
regulatory and non-regulatory barriers to energy efficiency, as regards split incentives between owners and tenants 
or among owners of a building or building units. Member States should continue working in that direction and tap 
the potential for energy efficiency in the context of the 2016 Eurostat statistics, in particular the fact that more than 
four out of ten Europeans live in flats and more than three out of ten Europeans are tenants.
(135) Member States, including regional and local authorities, should be encouraged to make full use of the European 
funds available under the multiannual financial framework for the years 2021 to 2027 laid down in Council 
Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2093 (29)the Recovery and Resilience Facility, established by Regulation 
(EU) 2021/241 of the European Parliament and of the Council (30), as well as the financial instruments and technical 
assistance available under the InvestEU programme, established by Regulation (EU) 2021/523 of the European 
Parliament and of the Council (31), to trigger private and public investments in energy efficiency improvement 
measures. Investment in energy efficiency has the potential to contribute to economic growth, employment, innovation and a reduction in energy poverty in households, and therefore makes a positive contribution to 
economic, social and territorial cohesion and green recovery. Potential areas for funding include energy efficiency 
measures in public buildings and housing, and providing new skills through the development of training, reskilling 
and upskilling of professionals, in particular in jobs related to building renovation, to promote employment in the 
energy efficiency sector. The Commission will ensure synergies between the different funding instruments, in particular the funds in shared management and in direct management, such as the centrally-managed programmes 
Horizon Europe and LIFE, as well as between grants, loans and technical assistance to maximise their leverage effect 
on private financing and their impact on the achievement of energy efficiency policy objectives.
(136) Member States should encourage the use of financing facilities to further the objectives of this Directive. Such 
financing facilities could include financial contributions and fines for infringements of certain provisions of this 
Directive, resources allocated to energy efficiency under Article 10(3) of Directive 2003/87/EC, and resources allocated to energy efficiency in the European funds and programmes, and dedicated European financial 
instruments, such as the European Energy Efficiency Fund.
(137) Financing facilities could be based, where applicable, on resources allocated to energy efficiency from Union project 
bonds, resources allocated to energy efficiency from the EIB and other European financial institutions, in particular 
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the Council of Europe Development Bank, 
resources leveraged in financial institutions, national resources, including through the creation of regulatory and 
fiscal frameworks encouraging the implementation of energy efficiency initiatives and programmes, and revenues 
from annual emission allocations under Decision No 406/2009/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (
32).

5.6.2009, p. 136).EN Official Journal of the European Union L 231/24 20.9.2023  (138) The financing facilities could in particular use contributions, resources and revenues from those resources to enable 
and encourage private capital investment, in particular drawing on institutional investors, while using criteria 
ensuring the achievement of both environmental and social objectives for the granting of funds; make use of 
innovative financing mechanisms, including loan guarantees for private capital, loan guarantees to foster energy 
performance contracting, grants, subsidised loans and dedicated credit lines, third-party financing systems, that reduce the risks of energy efficiency projects and allow for cost-effective renovations even among low- and 
medium-revenue households; be linked to programmes or agencies which will aggregate and assess the quality of 
energy saving projects, provide technical assistance, promote the energy services market and help to generate consumer demand for energy services.
(139) The financing facilities could also provide appropriate resources to support training and certification programmes 
which improve and accredit skills for energy efficiency, provide resources for research on and demonstration and 
acceleration of uptake of small-scale and micro technologies in the generation of energy and the optimisation of the connections of those generators to the grid, be linked to programmes undertaking action to promote energy 
efficiency in all dwellings to prevent energy poverty and stimulate landlords letting dwellings to render their 
property as energy-efficient as possible, and provide appropriate resources to support social dialogue and standard- setting with the aim of improving energy efficiency and ensuring good working conditions and health and safety at 
work.
(140) Available Union funding programmes, financial instruments and innovative financing mechanisms should be used 
to give practical effect to the objective of improving the energy performance of public bodies’ buildings. In that 
respect, Member States may use their revenues from annual emission allocations under Decision No 406/2009/EC 
in the development of such mechanisms on a voluntary basis and taking into account national budgetary rules. The Commission and the Member States should provide regional and local administrations with adequate information 
on such Union funding programmes, financial instruments and innovative financing mechanisms.
(141) In the implementation of the energy efficiency target, the Commission should monitor the impact of the relevant 
measures on Directive 2003/87/EC in order to maintain the incentives in the EU ETS rewarding low carbon 
investments and to prepare the EU ETS sectors for the innovations needed in the future. It will need to monitor the 
impact on those industry sectors which are exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage as listed in the Annex to Commission Decision 2014/746/EU (
33), in order to ensure that this Directive promotes and does not impede the 
development of those sectors.
(142) Member State measures should be supported by well-designed and effective Union financial instruments under the InvestEU programme, and by financing from the EIB and the EBRD, which should support investments in energy 
efficiency at all stages of the energy chain and use a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis with a model of 
differentiated discount rates. Financial support should focus on cost-effective methods for increasing energy efficiency, which would lead to a reduction in energy consumption. The EIB and the EBRD should, together with 
national promotional banks, design, generate and finance programmes and projects tailored for the efficiency 
sector, including for energy-poor households.
(143) Cross-sectoral law provides a strong basis for consumer protection for a wide range of current energy services, and is 
likely to evolve. Nevertheless, certain basic contractual rights of customers should be clearly established. Plain and 
unambiguous information should be made available to consumers concerning their rights in relation to the energy sector.
(144) In order to be able to evaluate the effectiveness of this Directive, a requirement to conduct a general review of this Directive and to submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council by 28 February 2027 should be laid 
down. That review should allow necessary alignments, also taking into account economic and innovation 
developments.
(33)Commission Decision 2014/746/EU of 27 October 2014 determining, pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament 
and of the Council, a list of sectors and subsectors which are deemed to be exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage, for the 
period 2015 to 2019 (OJ L 308, 29.10.2014, p. 114).EN Official Journal of the European Union 20.9.2023 L 231/25  (145) Local and regional authorities should be given a leading role in the development and design, execution and 
assessment of the measures laid down in this Directive, so that they are able properly to address the specific features 
of their own climate, culture and society.
(146) Reflecting technological progress and the growing share of renewable energy sources in the electricity generation sector, the default coefficient for savings in kWh electricity should be reviewed in order to reflect changes in the primary energy factor for electricity and other energy carriers. The calculation methodology is in accordance with 
the Eurostat energy balances and definitions, except for the allocation method of fuel input for heat and electricity 
in combined heat and power plants, for which the efficiency of the reference system, required for the allocation of fuel consumption, was aligned with Eurostat data for 2015 and 2020. Calculations reflecting the energy mix of the 
primary energy factor for electricity are based on annual average values. The ‘physical energy content’ accounting 
method is used for nuclear electricity and heat generation and the ‘technical conversion efficiency’ method is used 
for electricity and heat generation from fossil fuels and biomass. For non-combustible renewable energy, the 
method is the direct equivalent based on the ‘total primary energy’ approach. To calculate the primary energy share 
for electricity in cogeneration, the method set out in this Directive is applied. An average rather than a marginal 
market position is used. Conversion efficiencies are assumed to be 100 % for non-combustible renewables, 10 % for geothermal power stations and 33 % for nuclear power stations. The calculation of total efficiency for cogeneration 
is based on the most recent data from Eurostat. The conversion, transmission and distribution losses are taken into 
account. Distribution losses for energy carriers other than electricity are not considered in the calculations, due to the lack of reliable data and the complexity of the calculation. As for system boundaries, the primary energy factor is 1 for all energy sources. The selected coefficient for the primary energy factor for electricity is the average of 
2024 and 2025 values, since a forward-looking primary energy factor will provide a more appropriate indicator 
than a historical one. The analysis covers the Member States and Norway. The dataset for Norway is based on the 
ENTSO-E data.
(147) Energy savings which result from the implementation of Union law should not be claimed unless they result from a measure that goes beyond the minimum required by the Union legal act in question, whether by setting more 
ambitious energy efficiency requirements at Member State level or by increasing the take-up of the measure. 
Buildings present a substantial potential for further increasing energy efficiency, and the renovation of buildings is an essential and long-term element with economies of scale in increasing energy savings. It is therefore necessary to clarify that it is possible to claim all energy savings stemming from measures promoting the renovation of existing 
buildings, provided that they exceed the savings that would have occurred in the absence of the policy measure and 
provided that the Member State demonstrates that the obligated, participating or entrusted party has in fact 
contributed to the achievement of the energy savings claimed.
(148) In accordance with the communication of the Commission of 25 February 2015 on ‘A Framework Strategy for a 
Resilient Energy Union with a Forward-Looking Climate Change Policy’ and the principles of better regulation, 
monitoring and verification rules for the implementation of energy efficiency obligation schemes and alternative 
policy measures, including the requirement to check a statistically representative sample of measures, should be 
given greater prominence.
(149) Energy generated on or in buildings from renewable energy technologies reduces the amount of energy supplied from fossil fuels. The reduction of energy consumption and the use of energy from renewable sources in the buildings sector are important measures to reduce the Union’s energy dependence and GHG emissions, especially in 
view of the ambitious climate and energy objectives set for 2030 as well as the global commitment made in the 
context of the Paris Agreement. For the purposes of their cumulative energy savings obligation, it is possible for Member States to take into account energy savings from policy measures promoting renewable technologies to 
meet their energy savings requirements in accordance with the calculation methodology provided for in this 
Directive. Energy savings from policy measures regarding the use of direct fossil fuel combustion should not be 
counted.EN Official Journal of the European Union L 231/26 20.9.2023  (150) Some of the changes introduced by this Directive might require a subsequent amendment to Regulation 
(EU) 2018/1999 in order to ensure coherence between the two legal acts. New provisions, mainly relating to setting 
national contributions, gap filling mechanisms and reporting obligations, should be streamlined with and 
transferred to that Regulation, once it is amended. Some provisions of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 might also need 
to be reassessed in view of the changes proposed in this Directive. The additional reporting and monitoring requirements should not create any new parallel reporting systems but would be subject to the existing monitoring 
and reporting framework under Regulation (EU) 2018/1999.
(151) To foster the practical implementation of this Directive at national, regional and local level, the Commission should 
continue to support the exchange of experiences on practices, benchmarking, networking activities, as well as 
innovative practices by means of an online platform.
(152) Since the objectives of this Directive, namely to achieve the Union’s energy efficiency target and to pave the way 
towards further energy efficiency improvements and towards climate neutrality, cannot be sufficiently achieved by 
the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, 
the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty 
on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive 
does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(153) In order to permit adaptation to technical progress and changes in the distribution of energy sources, the power to 
adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the review of 
the harmonised efficiency reference values laid down on the basis of this Directive, in respect of the values, 
calculation methods, default primary energy coefficient and requirements in the Annexes to this Directive and in 
respect of supplementing this Directive by establishing a common Union scheme for rating the sustainability of data 
centres located in its territory. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in 
accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law- 
Making (
34). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament 
and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically 
have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.
(154) Regulation (EU) 2023/955 should be amended in order to take account of the definition of energy poverty 
established in this Directive. That would ensure consistency, coherence, complementarity and synergy among 
different instruments and funding in particular addressing households in energy poverty.
(155) The obligation to transpose this Directive into national law should be confined to those provisions which represent a 
substantive amendment as compared to the earlier Directive. The obligation to transpose the provisions which are 
unchanged arises under the earlier Directive.
(156) This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for the 
transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Part B of Annex XVI,

CHAPTER I
SUBJECT MATTER, SCOPE, DEFINITIONS AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY TARGETS
Article 1
Subject matter and scope
1. This Directive establishes a common framework of measures to promote energy efficiency within the Union in order 
to ensure that the Union’s targets on energy efficiency are met and enables further energy efficiency improvements. The aim 
of that common framework is to contribute to the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European 
Parliament and of the Council (35)and to the Union’s security of energy supply by reducing its dependence on energy 
imports, including fossil fuels.
This Directive lays down rules designed to implement energy efficiency as a priority across all sectors, remove barriers in 
the energy market and overcome market failures that impede efficiency in the supply, transmission, storage and use of 
energy. It also provides for the establishment of indicative national energy efficiency contributions for 2030.
This Directive contributes to the implementation of the energy efficiency first principle, thus also contributing to the Union 
being an inclusive, fair and prosperous society with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy.
2. The requirements laid down in this Directive are minimum requirements and shall not prevent any Member State 
from maintaining or introducing more stringent measures. Such measures shall comply with Union law. Where national 
legislation provides for more stringent measures, the Member State shall notify such legislation to the Commission.

to ensure that it reaches its national energy efficiency contributions and the amount of energy savings expected to be 
delivered.
The Commission shall assess whether the national measures referred to in this paragraph are sufficient to achieve the 
Union’s energy efficiency targets. Where national measures are deemed to be insufficient, the Commission shall, as appropriate, propose measures and exercise its power at Union level in order to ensure, in particular, the achievement of 
the Union’s 2030 targets for energy efficiency.
7. The Commission shall assess by 31 December 2026 any methodological changes in the data reported pursuant to 
Regulation (EC) No 1099/2008, in the methodology for calculating energy balance, and in energy models for European

long-term planning tools, such as decarbonisation or sustainable energy plans, after consulting relevant stakeholders, 
including energy agencies where appropriate, and the public, including, in particular, vulnerable groups which are at risk 
of being affected by energy poverty or are more susceptible to its effects.
Member States shall also ensure that the competent authorities take actions to mitigate significant negative direct or indirect 
impacts of energy efficiency measures on energy poor, low-income households or vulnerable groups when designing and 
implementing energy efficiency measures.
7. Member States shall support public bodies. Such support may, without prejudice to the State aid rules, include 
financial and technical support, for the purpose of taking up energy efficiency improvement measures and encouraging 
public bodies to take into account the wider benefits beyond energy savings, for example the quality of the indoor 
environment, including at regional and local level, by providing guidelines, promoting competence building, the 
acquisition of skills and training opportunities, and by encouraging cooperation among public bodies.EN Official Journal of the European Union L 231/36 20.9.2023  8. Member States shall encourage public bodies to consider life cycle carbon emissions as well as the economic and 
social benefits of their public bodies’ investment and policy activities.
9. Member States shall encourage public bodies to improve the energy performance of buildings owned or occupied by 
public bodies, including by means of the replacement of old and inefficient heaters.
Article 6
Exemplary role of public bodies’ buildings
1. Without prejudice to Article 7 of Directive 2010/31/EU, each Member State shall ensure that at least 3 % of the total 
floor area of heated and/or cooled buildings that are owned by public bodies is renovated each year to be transformed into 
at least nearly zero-energy buildings or zero-emission buildings in accordance with Article 9 of Directive 2010/31/EU.
Member States may choose which buildings to include in the 3 % renovation requirement, giving due consideration to cost- 
effectiveness and technical feasibility in the choice of buildings to renovate.
Member States may exempt social housing from the obligation to renovate referred to in the first subparagraph where such 
renovations would not be cost neutral or would lead to rent increases for people living in social housing unless such rent 
increases are no higher than the economic savings on the energy bill.
Where public bodies occupy a building that they do not own, they shall negotiate with the owner, in particular when 
reaching a trigger point such as the renewal of rental, change of use, significant repair or maintenance work, with the aim 
of establishing contractual clauses for the building to become at least a nearly zero-energy building or zero- 
emission building.
The rate of at least 3 % shall be calculated on the total floor area of buildings which have a total useful floor area of over 
250 m2, that are owned by public bodies and that, on 1 January 2024, are not nearly zero-energy buildings.
2. Member States may apply requirements that are less stringent than those laid down in paragraph 1 for the following 
categories of buildings:
(a) buildings officially protected as part of a designated environment, or because of their special architectural or historical 
merit, in so far as compliance with certain minimum energy performance requirements would alter their character or 
appearance unacceptably;
(b) buildings owned by the armed forces or central government and serving national defence purposes, apart from single living quarters or office buildings for the armed forces and other staff employed by national defence authorities;
(c) buildings used as places of worship and for religious activities.
Member States may decide not to renovate any building that is not referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph up 
to the level provided for in paragraph 1 if they assess that it is not technically, economically or functionally feasible for that 
building to be transformed into a nearly zero-energy building. Where they so decide, Member States shall not count the 
renovation of that building towards the fulfilment of the requirement set out in paragraph 1.
3. In order to front load energy savings and to provide an incentive for early action, a Member State that renovates more 
than 3 % of the total floor area of its buildings in accordance with paragraph 1 in any year until 31 December 2026 may 
count the surplus towards the annual renovation rate of any of the following three years. A Member State that renovates 
more than 3 % of the total floor area of its buildings as of 1 January 2027 may count the surplus towards the annual 
renovation rate of the following two years.EN Official Journal of the European Union 20.9.2023 L 231/37  4. Member States may count towards the annual renovation rate of buildings new buildings owned as replacements for 
specific public bodies’ buildings demolished in any of the two previous years. This shall apply only where they would be 
more cost effective and sustainable in terms of the energy and lifecycle CO 2 emissions achieved compared to the 
renovations of such buildings. The general criteria, methodologies and procedures to identify such exceptional cases shall 
be clearly set out and published by each Member State.
5. By 11 October 2025, Member States shall, for the purposes of this Article, establish and make publicly available and 
accessible an inventory of heated and/or cooled buildings that are owned or occupied by public bodies and that have a total 
useful floor area of more than 250 m2. Member States shall update that inventory at least every two years. The inventory 
shall be linked to the building stock overview carried out in the framework of the national building renovation plans in accordance with Directive 2010/31/EU and the relevant databases.
Publicly available and accessible data about building stock characteristics, buildings renovation and energy performance 
may be aggregated by the EU Building Stock Observatory to ensure a better understanding of the energy performance of 
the building sector through comparable data.
The inventory shall contain at least the following data:
(a) the floor area in m
2;
(b) the measured annual energy consumption of heat, cooling, electricity and hot water when those data are available;
(c) the energy performance certificate of each building issued in accordance with Directive 2010/31/EU.
6. Member States may decide to apply an alternative approach to that set out in paragraphs 1 to 4 for the purpose of 
achieving, every year, an amount of energy savings in the buildings of public bodies which is at least equivalent to the 
amount required in paragraph 1.
For the purpose of applying that alternative approach, Member States shall:
(a) ensure that, each year, a renovation passport is introduced, where applicable, for buildings representing at least 3 % of 
the total floor area of heated and/or cooled buildings that are owned by public bodies. For those buildings, the 
renovation to nearly zero-energy building shall be achieved at the latest by 2040;
(b) estimate the energy savings that paragraphs 1 to 4 would generate by using appropriate standard values for the energy 
consumption of reference public bodies’ buildings before and after renovation to be transformed into nearly zero- 
energy buildings as referred to in Directive 2010/31/EU.
Member States that decide to apply the alternative approach shall notify to the Commission, by 31 December 2023, their 
projected energy savings to achieve at least the equivalent of energy savings in the buildings covered by paragraph 1 
by 31 December 2030.
Article 7
Public procurement
1. Member States shall ensure that contracting authorities and contracting entities, when concluding public contracts 
and concessions with a value equal to or greater than the thresholds laid down in Article 8 of Directive 2014/23/EU, 
Article 4 of Directive 2014/24/EU and Article 15 of Directive 2014/25/EU, purchase only products, services buildings and 
works with high energy-efficiency performance in accordance with the requirements referred to in Annex IV to this 
Directive, unless it is not technically feasible.EN Official Journal of the European Union L 231/38 20.9.2023  Member States shall also ensure that in concluding the public contracts and concessions with a value equal to or greater 
than the thresholds referred to in the first subparagraph, contracting authorities and contracting entities apply the energy 
efficiency first principle in accordance with Article 3, including for those public contracts and concessions for which no specific requirements are provided for in Annex IV.
2. The obligations referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall not apply if they undermine public security or impede 
the response to public health emergencies. The obligations referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall apply to the 
contracts of the armed forces only to the extent that their application does not cause any conflict with the nature and 
primary aim of the activities of the armed forces. The obligations shall not apply to contracts for the supply of military equipment as defined in Directive 2009/81/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (
39).
3. Notwithstanding Article 29(4), Member States shall ensure that contracting authorities and contracting entities assess 
the feasibility of concluding long-term energy performance contracts that provide long-term energy savings when 
procuring service contracts with significant energy content.
4. Without prejudice to paragraph 1 of this Article, when purchasing a product package fully covered by a delegated act 
adopted under Regulation (EU) 2017/1369, Member States may require that the aggregate energy efficiency take priority 
over the energy efficiency of individual products within that package, by purchasing the product package that complies with the criterion of belonging to the highest available energy efficiency class.
5. Member States may require that contracting authorities and contracting entities, when concluding contracts as 
referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, take into account, where appropriate, wider sustainability, social, environmental 
and circular economy aspects in procurement practices with a view to achieving the Union’s decarbonisation and zero 
pollution objectives. Where appropriate, and in accordance with Annex IV, Member States shall require contracting authorities and contracting entities to take into account Union green public procurement criteria or available equivalent national criteria.
To ensure transparency in the application of energy efficiency requirements in the procurement process, Member States 
shall ensure that contracting authorities and contracting entities make publicly available information on the energy 
efficiency impact of contracts with a value equal to or greater than the thresholds referred to in paragraph 1 by publishing 
that information in the respective notices on Tenders Electronic Daily (TED), in accordance with Directives 2014/23/EU, 2014/24/EU and 2014/25/EU, and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1780 (
40). Contracting authorities 
may decide to require that tenderers disclose information on the life cycle global warming potential, the use of low carbon materials and the circularity of materials used for a new building and for a building to be renovated. Contracting authorities 
may make that information publicly available for the contracts, in particular for new buildings having a floor area larger 
than 2 000 m
2.
Member States shall support contracting authorities and contracting entities in the uptake of energy efficiency 
requirements, including at regional and local level, by providing clear rules and guidelines including methodologies on the 
assessment of life cycle costs and environment impacts and costs, setting up competence support centres, encouraging 
cooperation amongst contracting authorities, including across borders, and using aggregated procurement and digital 
procurement where possible.

in the application of energy efficiency requirements in the procurement process. Such support may strengthen existing 
fora for the purpose of supporting Member States, such as by means of concerted action, and may assist them in taking 
the green public procurement criteria into account.
7. Member States shall establish the legal and regulatory provisions, and administrative practices, regarding public 
purchasing and annual budgeting and accounting, necessary to ensure that individual contracting authorities are not 
deterred from making investments in improving energy efficiency and from using energy performance contracting and third-party financing mechanisms on a long-term contractual basis.
8. Member States shall remove any regulatory or non-regulatory barriers to energy efficiency, in particular as regards 
legal and regulatory provisions, and administrative practices, regarding public purchasing and annual budgeting and 
accounting, with a view to ensuring that individual public bodies are not deterred from making investments in improving 
energy efficiency and from using energy performance contracting and third-party financing mechanisms on a long-term 
contractual basis.
Member States shall report to the Commission on the measures taken to address the barriers to uptake of energy efficiency 
improvements as part of their integrated national energy and climate progress reports submitted pursuant to Article 17 of 
Regulation (EU) 2018/1999.
CHAPTER III
EFFICIENCY IN ENERGY USE
Article 8
Energy savings obligation
1. Member States shall achieve cumulative end-use energy savings at least equivalent to:
(a) new savings each year from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020 of 1,5 % of annual energy sales to final customers by 
volume, averaged over the most recent three-year period preceding 1 January 2013. Sales of energy, by volume, used in 
transport may be excluded, in whole or in part, from that calculation;
(b) new savings each year from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2030 of:
(i) 0,8 % of annual final energy consumption from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2023, averaged over the most 
recent three-year period preceding 1 January 2019;
(ii) 1,3 % of annual final energy consumption from 1 January 2024 to 31 December 2025, averaged over the most 
recent three-year period preceding 1 January 2019;
(iii) 1,5 % of annual final energy consumption from 1 January 2026 to 31 December 2027, averaged over the most 
recent three-year period preceding 1 January 2019;
(iv) 1,9 % of annual final energy consumption from 1 January 2028 to 31 December 2030, averaged over the most 
recent three-year period preceding 1 January 2019.
By way of derogation from point (b)(i) of the first subparagraph, Cyprus and Malta shall achieve new savings each year from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2023, equivalent to 0,24 % of annual final energy consumption, averaged over the most 
recent three-year period prior to 1 January 2019.
By way of derogation from points (b)(ii), (iii) and (iv) of the first subparagraph, Cyprus and Malta shall achieve new savings 
each year from 1 January 2024 to 31 December 2030 equivalent to 0,45 % of annual FEC, averaged over the most recent 
three-year period preceding 1 January 2019.EN Official Journal of the European Union L 231/40 20.9.2023  Member States shall decide how to phase the calculated quantity of new savings over each period referred to in points (a) 
and (b) of the first subparagraph, provided that the required total cumulative end-use energy savings have been achieved 
by the end of each obligation period.
Member States shall continue to achieve new annual savings in accordance with the savings rate provided for in point (b)(iv) 
of the first subparagraph for ten-year periods after 2030.
2. Member States shall achieve the amount of energy savings required under paragraph 1 of this Article either by 
establishing an energy efficiency obligation scheme as referred to in Article 9 or by adopting alternative policy measures as 
referred to in Article 10. Member States may combine an energy efficiency obligation scheme with alternative policy 
measures. Member States shall ensure that energy savings resulting from the policy measures referred to in Articles 9 
and 10 and Article 30(14) are calculated in accordance with Annex V.
3. Member States shall implement energy efficiency obligation schemes, alternative policy measures, or a combination 
of both, or programmes or measures financed under a national energy efficiency fund, as a priority among, but not limited 
to, people affected by energy poverty, vulnerable customers, people in low-income households and, where applicable, 
people living in social housing. Member States shall ensure that policy measures implemented pursuant to this Article have 
no adverse effect on those persons. Where applicable, Member States shall make the best possible use of funding, including 
public funding, funding facilities established at Union level, and revenues from allowances pursuant to Article 24(3), point 
(b), with the aim of removing adverse effects and ensuring a just and inclusive energy transition.
For the purpose of achieving the energy savings required under paragraph 1 and without prejudice to Regulation 
(EU) 2019/943 and Directive (EU) 2019/944, Member States shall, for the purpose of designing such policy measures, 
consider and promote the role of renewable energy communities and citizen energy communities in the contribution to 
the implementation towards those policy measures.
Member States shall establish and achieve a share of the required amount of cumulative end-use energy savings among 
people affected by energy poverty, vulnerable customers, people in low-income households and, where applicable, people 
living in social housing. This share shall at least be equal to the proportion of households in energy poverty as assessed in 
their national energy and climate plans established in accordance with Article 3(3), point (d), of Regulation 
(EU) 2018/1999. Member States shall, in their assessment of the share of energy poverty in their national energy and 
climate plans, consider the following indicators:
(a) the inability to keep the home adequately warm (Eurostat, SILC [ilc_mdes01]);
(b) the arrears on utility bills (Eurostat, SILC [ilc_mdes07]);
(c) the total population living in a dwelling with a leaking roof, damp walls, floors or foundation, or rot in window frames 
or floor (Eurostat, SILC [ilc_mdho01]);
(d) at-risk-of-poverty rate (Eurostat, SILC and ECHP surveys [ilc_li02]) (cutoff point: 60 % of median equivalised income 
after social transfers).
If a Member State has not notified the share of households in energy poverty as assessed in their national energy and climate 
plan, the share of the required amount of cumulative end-use energy savings among people affected by energy poverty, 
vulnerable customers, people in low-income households and, where applicable, people living in social housing, shall be at 
least equal to the arithmetic average share of the indicators referred to in the third subparagraph for the year 2019 or, if 
not available for 2019, for the linear extrapolation of their values for the last three years that are available.EN Official Journal of the European Union 20.9.2023 L 231/41  4. Member States shall include information about the indicators applied, the arithmetic average share and the outcome 
of policy measures established in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article in the updates of their integrated national 
energy and climate plans submitted pursuant to Article 14(2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, in their subsequent integrated national energy and climate plans notified pursuant to Article 3 and Articles 7 to 12 of that Regulation, and in 
the related national energy and climate progress reports submitted pursuant to Article 17 of that Regulation.
5. Member States may count energy savings that stem from policy measures, whether introduced by 31 December 2020
or after that date, provided that those measures result in new individual actions that are carried out after 31 December 
2020. Energy savings achieved in any obligation period shall not count towards the amount of required energy savings for 
the previous obligation periods set out in paragraph 1.
6. Provided that Member States achieve at least their cumulative end-use energy savings obligation referred to in 
paragraph 1, first subparagraph, point (b)(i), they may calculate the required amount of energy savings referred to in that 
point by one or more of the following means:
(a) applying an annual savings rate on energy sales to final customers or on final energy consumption, averaged over the 
most recent three-year period preceding 1 January 2019;
(b) excluding, in whole or in part, energy used in transport from the calculation baseline;
(c) making use of any of the options set out in paragraph 8.
7. Where Member States make use of any of the possibilities provided for in paragraph 6 regarding the required energy 
savings referred to in paragraph 1, first subparagraph, point (b)(i), they shall establish:
(a) their own annual savings rate that will be applied in the calculation of their cumulative end-use energy savings, which 
shall ensure that the final amount of their net energy savings is no lower than those required under that point;
(b) their own calculation baseline, which may exclude, in whole or in part, energy used in transport.
8. Subject to paragraph 9, each Member State may:
(a) carry out the calculation required under paragraph 1, first subparagraph, point (a), using values of 1 % in 2014 
and 2015, 1,25 % in 2016 and 2017, and 1,5 % in 2018, 2019 and 2020;
(b) exclude from the calculation all or part of the sales of energy used, by volume, with respect to the obligation period referred to in paragraph 1, first subparagraph, point (a), or final energy consumed, with respect to the obligation 
period referred to in point (b)(i), of that subparagraph, by industrial activities listed in Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC;
(c) count towards the amount of required energy savings in paragraph 1, first subparagraph, points (a) and (b)(i), energy savings achieved in the energy transformation, distribution and transmission sectors, including efficient district heating and cooling infrastructure, as a result of implementing the requirements set out in in Article 25(4), point (a), 
of Article 26(7), and Article 27(1), (5) to (9) and (11). Member States shall inform the Commission about their 
intended policy measures under this point for the period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2030 as part of their 
integrated national energy and climate plans notified pursuant to Article 3 and Articles 7 to 12. The impact of those 
measures shall be calculated in accordance with Annex V and included in those plans;
(d) count towards the amount of required energy savings, energy savings resulting from individual actions newly implemented since 31 December 2008 that continue to have an impact in 2020 with respect to the obligation period 
referred to in paragraph 1, first subparagraph, point (a), and beyond 2020 with respect to the period referred to in point (b)(i), of that subparagraph, and which can be measured and verified;EN Official Journal of the European Union L 231/42 20.9.2023  (e) count towards the amount of required energy savings, energy savings that stem from policy measures, provided that it 
can be demonstrated that those measures result in individual actions carried out from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 
2020 which deliver savings after 31 December 2020;
(f) exclude from the calculation of the amount of required energy savings pursuant to paragraph 1, first subparagraph, points (a) and (b)(i), 30 % of the verifiable amount of energy generated on or in buildings for own use as a result of 
policy measures promoting new installation of renewable energy technologies;
(g) count towards the amount of required energy savings pursuant to paragraph 1, first subparagraph, points (a) and (b)(i), energy savings that exceed the energy savings required for the obligation period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 
2020, provided that those savings result from individual actions carried out under policy measures referred to in Articles 9 and 10, notified by Member States in their national energy efficiency action plans and reported in their progress reports in accordance with Article 26.
9. Member States shall apply and calculate the effect of the options chosen under paragraph 8 for the period referred to 
in paragraph 1, first subparagraph, points (a) and (b)(i), separately:
(a) for the calculation of the amount of energy savings required for the obligation period referred to in paragraph 1, first 
subparagraph, point (a), Member States may make use of the options listed in paragraph 8, points (a) to (d). All the options chosen under paragraph 8 taken together shall amount to no more than 25 % of the amount of energy savings referred to in paragraph 1, first subparagraph, point (a);
(b) for the calculation of the amount of energy savings required for the obligation period referred to in paragraph 1, first 
subparagraph, point (b)(i), Member States may make use of the options listed in paragraph 8, points (b) to (g), provided 
that the individual actions referred to in paragraph 8, point (d), continue to have a verifiable and measurable impact after 31 December 2020. All the options chosen under paragraph 8 taken together shall not lead to a reduction of 
more than 35 % of the amount of energy savings calculated in accordance with paragraphs 6 and 7.
Regardless of whether Member States exclude, in whole or in part, energy used in transport from their calculation baseline or make use of any of the options listed in paragraph 8, they shall ensure that the calculated net amount of new savings to be achieved in final energy consumption during the obligation period referred to in paragraph 1, first subparagraph, point (b)(i), from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2023 is not lower than the amount resulting from applying the annual savings 
rate referred to in that point.
10. Member States shall describe in the updates of their integrated national energy and climate plans submitted pursuant 
to Article 14(2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, in their subsequent integrated national energy and climate plans notified 
pursuant to Article 3 and Articles 7 to 12 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 and in accordance with Annex III to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, and respective progress reports the calculation of the amount of energy savings to be achieved over the period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2030 and shall, if relevant, explain how the annual savings rate and the 
calculation baseline were established, and how and to what extent the options referred to in paragraph 8 of this Article were applied.
11. Member States shall notify the Commission of the amount of the required energy savings referred to in paragraph 1, 
first subparagraph, point (b), and paragraph 3 of this Article, a description of the policy measures to be implemented to 
achieve the required total amount of the cumulative end-use energy savings and their calculation methodologies pursuant 
to Annex V to this Directive, as part of the updates of their integrated national energy and climate plans submitted 
pursuant to Article 14(2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, and as part of their integrated national energy and climate plans notified pursuant to Article 3 and Articles 7 to 12 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. Member States shall use the reporting 
template provided to the Member States by the Commission.EN Official Journal of the European Union 20.9.2023 L 231/43  12. Where on the basis of the assessment of the integrated national energy and climate progress reports pursuant to 
Article 29 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, or of the draft or final update of the latest notified integrated national energy 
and climate plan submitted pursuant to Article 14 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, or of the assessment of the subsequent 
draft and final integrated national energy and climate plans notified pursuant to Article 3 and Articles 7 to 12 of 
Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, the Commission concludes that policy measures do not ensure the achievement of the 
required amount of cumulative end-use energy savings by the end of the obligation period, the Commission may issue 
recommendations in accordance with Article 34 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 to the Member States whose policy 
measures it deems to be insufficient to ensure the fulfilment of their energy savings obligations.
13. Where a Member State has not achieved the required cumulative end-use energy savings by the end of each 
obligation period set out in paragraph 1, it shall achieve the outstanding energy savings in addition to the cumulative end- 
use energy savings required by the end of the following obligation period.
Alternatively, where a Member State has achieved cumulative end-use energy savings above the required level by the end of 
each obligation period set out in paragraph 1, it shall be entitled to carry the eligible amount of no more than 10 % of such 
surplus into the following obligation period without the target commitment being increased.
14. As part of their updates of national energy and climate plans submitted pursuant to Article 14(2) of Regulation 
(EU) 2018/1999, their relevant national energy and climate progress reports submitted pursuant to Article 17 of that 
Regulation, and their subsequent integrated national energy and climate plans notified pursuant to Article 3 and Articles 7 
to 12 of that Regulation, Member States shall demonstrate including, where appropriate, with evidence and calculations:
(a) that where there is an overlap in the impact of policy measures or individual actions, there is no double counting of 
energy savings;
(b) how energy savings achieved pursuant to paragraph 1, first subparagraph, point (b), of this Article, contribute to the achievement of their national contribution pursuant to Article 4;
(c) that policy measures are established for fulfilling their energy savings obligation, designed in compliance with this Article and that those policy measures are eligible and appropriate to ensure the achievement of the required amount 
of cumulative end-use energy savings by the end of each obligation period.
Article 9
Energy efficiency obligation schemes
1. Where Member States decide to fulfil their obligations to achieve the amount of savings required under Article 8(1) by 
way of an energy efficiency obligation scheme, they shall ensure that the obligated parties referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article operating in each Member State’s territory achieve, without prejudice to Article 8(8) and (9), their cumulative end- 
use energy savings requirement as set out in Article 8(1).
Where applicable, Member States may decide that obligated parties fulfil those savings, in whole or in part, as a 
contribution to the national energy efficiency fund in accordance with Article 30(14).
2. Where Member States decide to fulfil their obligations to achieve the amount of savings required under Article 8(1) by 
way of an energy efficiency obligation scheme, they may appoint an implementing public authority to administer the 
scheme.EN Official Journal of the European Union L 231/44 20.9.2023  3. Member States shall designate, on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory criteria, obligated parties among 
transmission system operators, distribution system operators, energy distributors, retail energy sales companies and 
transport fuel distributors or transport fuel retailers operating in their territory. The amount of energy savings needed to fulfil the obligation shall be achieved by the obligated parties among final customers, designated by the Member State, 
independently of the calculation made pursuant to Article 8(1) or, if Member States so decide, through certified savings 
stemming from other parties as set out in paragraph 11, point (a), of this Article.
4. Where retail energy sales companies are designated as obligated parties under paragraph 3, Member States shall 
ensure that, in fulfilling their obligation, retail energy sales companies do not create any barriers that impede consumers 
from switching from one supplier to another.
5. Member States may require obligated parties to achieve a share of their energy savings obligation among people 
affected by energy poverty, vulnerable customers, people in low-income households and, where applicable, people living in 
social housing. Member States may also require obligated parties to achieve energy cost reduction targets, provided that 
they result in end use energy savings and are calculated in accordance with Annex V, and to achieve energy savings by 
promoting energy efficiency improvement measures, including financial support measures mitigating carbon price effects 
on SMEs and microenterprises.
6. Member States may require obligated parties to work with social services, regional authorities, local authorities or 
municipalities to promote energy efficiency improvement measures among people affected by energy poverty, vulnerable 
customers, people in low-income households and, where applicable, people living in social housing. This includes 
identifying and addressing the specific needs of particular groups at risk of energy poverty or more susceptible to its 
effects. To protect people affected by energy poverty, vulnerable customers and, where applicable, people living in social housing, Member States shall encourage obligated parties to carry out actions such as renovation of buildings, including 
social housing, replacement of appliances, financial support and incentives for energy efficiency improvement measures in 
accordance with national financing and support schemes, or energy audits. Member States shall ensure the eligibility of 
measures for individual units located in multi-apartment buildings.
7. When applying paragraphs 5 and 6, Member States shall require obligated parties to report on an annual basis on the 
energy savings achieved by the obligated parties from actions promoted among people affected by energy poverty, 
vulnerable customers, people in low-income households and, where applicable, people living in social housing, and shall require aggregated statistical information on their final customers, identifying changes in energy savings when compared 
to previously submitted information, and regarding technical and financial support provided.
8. Member States shall express the amount of energy savings required of each obligated party in terms of either primary 
energy consumption or final energy consumption. The method chosen to express the amount of energy savings required 
shall also be used to calculate the savings claimed by obligated parties. When converting the amount of energy savings, the

9. Without prejudice to the basic principles of their laws on property and tenancy, Member States shall take the 
necessary measures to remove regulatory and non-regulatory barriers to energy efficiency as regards split incentives 
between owners and tenants, or among owners of a building or building unit, with a view to ensuring that those parties 
are not deterred from making efficiency-improving investments that they would otherwise have made by the fact that they 
will not individually obtain the full benefits or by the absence of rules for dividing the costs and benefits between them.
Measures to remove such barriers may include providing incentives, repealing or amending legal or regulatory provisions, 
adopting guidelines and interpretative communications, simplifying administrative procedures, including national rules 
and measures regulating decision-making processes in multi-owner properties, and the possibility to turn to third-party 
financing solutions. The measures may be combined with the provision of education, training and specific information 
and technical assistance on energy efficiency to market actors such as those referred to in paragraph 1.

PECC2030¼ CEUð1 – TargetÞ PECB2030
Where C EU is a correction factor, Target is the level of national-specific ambition and FEC B2030 PEC B2030 is the 2020 
EU Reference Scenario used as a baseline for 2030.
2. The following indicative formula represents the objective criteria reflecting the factors listed in Article 4(3), points (d) 
(i) to (iv), each used for defining the level of national-specific ambition in % (Target) and having the same weight in the formula (0,25):
(a) early action dependent contribution (‘F
early-action ’);
(b) GDP-per-capita dependent contribution (‘F wealth ’);
(c) energy intensity dependent contribution (‘F intensity ’);
(d) cost-effective energy savings potential contribution (‘F potential ’).
3. Fearly-action shall be calculated for each Member State as the product of its amount of energy savings and the 
improvement in the energy intensity that each Member State achieved. The amount of energy savings for each Member State shall be calculated on the basis of the reduction of energy consumption (in toe) to the Union’s 
reduction of energy consumption between the three-year average for the period 2007-2009 and the three-year 
average for the period 2017-2019. The improvement in the energy intensity for each Member State shall be 
calculated on the basis of the reduction of energy intensity (in toe/EUR) to the Union’s reduction of energy intensity 
between the three-year average for the period 2007-2009 and the three-year average for the period 2017-2019.
4. F
wealth shall be calculated for each Member State on the basis of its three-year average Eurostat's real GDP per capita 
index to the Union’s three-year average over the 2017-2019 period, expressed in Purchasing power parities (PPPs).
5. Fintensity shall be calculated for each Member State on the basis of its three-year average final energy intensity (FEC or 
PEC per real GDP in PPPs) index to the Union’s three-year average over 2017-2019 period.
6. Fpotential shall be calculated for each Member State on the basis of the final or primary energy savings under the 
PRIMES MIX 55 % scenario for 2030. The savings are expressed in relation to 2020 EU Reference Scenario projections for 2030.
7. For each criteria provided in point 2(a) to (d), a lower and upper limit shall be applied. The level of ambition for factors F
wealth Fintensity and F potential shall be capped at 50 % and 150 % of the Union average level of ambition under a 
given factor. The level of ambition for factor F early-action shall be capped at 50 % and 100 % of the Union average level 
of ambition.
8. The source of the input data used to calculate the factors is Eurostat unless stated otherwise.EN Official Journal of the European Union L 231/76 20.9.2023  9. Ftotal shall be calculated as the weighted sum of all four factors (F early-action . Fwealth Fintensity and F potential ). The target shall 
be then calculated as the product of the total factor F total and the Union target.
10. The Commission shall calculate a primary and final energy correction factor C EU, which shall be applied to adjust the 
sum of the formula results for all national contributions to the respective Union targets in 2030. The factor C EU is 
identical for all Member States.EN Official Journal of the European Union 20.9.2023 L 231/77  ANNEX II 
GENERAL PRINCIPLES FOR THE CALCULATION OF ELECTRICITY FROM COGENERATION 
Part I
General principles
Values used for calculation of electricity from cogeneration shall be determined on the basis of the expected or actual 
operation of the unit under normal conditions of use. For micro-cogeneration units the calculation may be based on 
certified values.
(1) Electricity production from cogeneration shall be considered equal to total annual electricity production of the unit 
measured at the outlet of the main generators if the following conditions are met:
(a) in cogeneration units of types (2), (4), (5), (6), (7) and (8) as referred to in Part II with an annual overall efficiency set 
by Member States at a level of at least 75 %;
(b) in cogeneration units of types (1) and (3) as referred to in Part II with an annual overall efficiency set by Member 
States at a level of at least 80 %.
(2) In cogeneration units with an annual overall efficiency below the value referred to in point (1)(a), namely the cogeneration units of types (2), (4), (5), (6), (7), and (8) as referred to in Part II, or with an annual overall efficiency 
below the value referred to in point (1)(b), namely the cogeneration units of types (1) and (3) as referred to in Part II, 
electricity from cogeneration is calculated according to the following formula:
E
CHP=H CHP*C
where:
ECHP is the amount of electricity from cogeneration;
C is the power-to-heat ratio;H
CHP is the amount of useful heat from cogeneration (calculated for this purpose as total heat production minus any 
heat produced in separate boilers or by live steam extraction from the steam generator before the turbine).The calculation of electricity from cogeneration shall be based on the actual power-to-heat ratio. If the actual power-to- 
heat ratio of a cogeneration unit is not known, the following default values may be used, in particular for statistical 
purposes, for units of types (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) as referred to in Part II provided that the calculated cogeneration 
electricity is less or equal to total electricity production of the unit:
Type of the unit Default power to heat ratio, C
Combined cycle gas turbine with heat recovery 0,95
Steam back pressure turbine 0,45
Steam condensing extraction turbine 0,45
Gas turbine with heat recovery 0,55
Internal combustion engine 0,75
If Member States introduce default values for power-to-heat ratios for units of types (6), (7), (8), (9), (10) and (11) as 
referred to in Part II, such default values shall be published and shall be notified to the Commission.
(3) If a share of the energy content of the fuel input to the cogeneration process is recovered in chemicals and recycled, that share can be subtracted from the fuel input before calculating the overall efficiency used in points (1) and (2).EN Official Journal of the European Union L 231/78 20.9.2023  (4) Member States may determine the power-to-heat ratio as the ratio of electricity to useful heat when operating in 
cogeneration mode at a lower capacity using operational data of the specific unit.
(5) Member States may use reporting periods other than annual reporting periods for the purpose of the calculations in 
accordance with points (1) and (2).
Part II

(4) Gas turbine with heat recovery
(5) Internal combustion engine
(6) Microturbines
(7) Stirling engines
(8) Fuel cells
(9) Steam engines
(10) Organic Rankine cycles
(11) Any other type of technology or combination comprising cogeneration.
When implementing and applying the general principles for the calculation of electricity from cogeneration, Member States shall use the detailed Guidelines established by Commission Decision 2008/952/EC (
1).
(1)Commission Decision 2008/952/EC of 19 November 2008 establishing detailed guidelines for the implementation and application of 
Annex II to Directive 2004/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 338, 17.12.2008, p. 55).EN Official Journal of the European Union 20.9.2023 L 231/79  ANNEX III 
METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE COGENERATION PROCESS 
Values used for calculation of efficiency of cogeneration and primary energy savings shall be determined on the basis of the 
expected or actual operation of the unit under normal conditions of use.
(a) High-efficiency cogeneration
For the purpose of this Directive, high-efficiency cogeneration shall fulfil the following criteria:
— cogeneration production from cogeneration units shall provide primary energy savings calculated in accordance with 
point (b) of at least 10 % compared with the references for separate production of heat and electricity;
— production from small-scale and micro-cogeneration units providing primary energy savings may qualify as high- 
efficiency cogeneration;
— for cogeneration units that are built or substantially refurbished after the transposition of this Annex, direct emissions 
of the carbon dioxide from cogeneration production that is fuelled with fossil fuels, are less than 270 gCO 2 per 1 kWh 
of energy output from the combined generation (including heating/cooling, power and mechanical energy);
— cogeneration units in operation before 10 October 2023, may derogate from this requirement until 1 January 2034
provided that they have a plan to reduce progressively the emissions to meet the threshold of less than 270 gCO 2 per 1 
kWh by 1 January 2034 and that they have notified this plan to relevant operators and competent authorities.
When a cogeneration unit is built or substantially refurbished, Member States shall ensure that there is no increase in the 
use of fossil fuels other than natural gas in existing heat sources compared to the annual consumption averaged over the 
previous three calendar years of full operation before refurbishment, and that any new heat sources in that system do not 
use fossil fuels other than natural gas.
(b) Calculation of primary energy savings
The amount of primary energy savings provided by cogeneration production defined in accordance with Annex II shall be 
calculated on the basis of the following formula:
Where:
PES is primary energy savings.
CHP Hη is the heat efficiency of the cogeneration production defined as annual useful heat output divided by the fuel input 
used to produce the sum of useful heat output and electricity from cogeneration.
Ref Hη is the efficiency reference value for separate heat production.
CHP Eη is the electrical efficiency of the cogeneration production defined as annual electricity from cogeneration divided by 
the fuel input used to produce the sum of useful heat output and electricity from cogeneration. Where a cogeneration unit 
generates mechanical energy, the annual electricity from cogeneration may be increased by an additional element 
representing the amount of electricity which is equivalent to that of mechanical energy. This additional element does not 
create a right to issue guarantees of origin in accordance with Article 26(13).
Ref Eη is the efficiency reference value for separate electricity production.EN Official Journal of the European Union L 231/80 20.9.2023  (c) Calculations of energy savings using alternative calculation
Member States may calculate primary energy savings from a production of heat and electricity and mechanical energy as 
indicated below without applying Annex II to exclude the non-cogenerated heat and electricity parts of the same process. 
Such a production can be regarded as high-efficiency cogeneration provided that it fulfils the efficiency criteria set out in 
point (a) of this Annex and, for cogeneration units with an electrical capacity larger than 25 MW, the overall efficiency is 
above 70 %. However, specification of the quantity of electricity from cogeneration produced in such a production, for 
issuing a guarantee of origin and for statistical purposes, shall be determined in accordance with Annex II.
If primary energy savings for a process are calculated using alternative calculation as indicated above the primary energy 
savings shall be calculated using the formula in point (b) of this Annex replacing: ‘CHP Hη’ with ‘Hη’ and ‘CHP Eη’ with ‘Eη’, 
where:
Hη means the heat efficiency of the process, defined as the annual heat output divided by the fuel input used to produce the 
sum of heat output and electricity output.
Eη means the electricity efficiency of the process, defined as the annual electricity output divided by the fuel input used to 
produce the sum of heat output and electricity output. Where a cogeneration unit generates mechanical energy, the annual 
electricity from cogeneration may be increased by an additional element representing the amount of electricity which is 
equivalent to that of mechanical energy. This additional element will not create a right to issue guarantees of origin in 
accordance with Article 26(13).
Member States may use reporting periods other than annual reporting periods for the purpose of the calculations in 
accordance with points (b) and (c) of this Annex.
For micro-cogeneration units the calculation of primary energy savings may be based on certified data.
(d) Efficiency reference values for separate production of heat and electricity
The harmonised efficiency reference values shall consist of a matrix of values differentiated by relevant factors, including 
year of construction and types of fuel, and shall be based on a well-documented analysis taking into account, inter alia, 
data from operational use under realistic conditions, fuel mix and climate conditions as well as applied cogeneration 
technologies.
The efficiency reference values for separate production of heat and electricity in accordance with the formula set out in 
point (b) shall establish the operating efficiency of the separate heat and electricity production that cogeneration is 
intended to substitute.
The efficiency reference values shall be calculated according to the following principles:
(i) for cogeneration units the comparison with separate electricity production shall be based on the principle that the 
same fuel categories are compared;
(ii) each cogeneration unit shall be compared with the best available and economically justifiable technology for separate production of heat and electricity on the market in the year of construction of the cogeneration unit;
(iii) the efficiency reference values for cogeneration units older than 10 years shall be fixed on the reference values of units 
of 10 years;
(iv) the efficiency reference values for separate electricity production and heat production shall reflect the climatic differences between Member States.EN Official Journal of the European Union 20.9.2023 L 231/81  ANNEX IV 
ENERGY EFFICIENCY REQUIREMENTS FOR PUBLIC PROCUREMENT 
In award procedures for public contracts and concessions, contracting authorities and contracting entities that purchase 
products, services, buildings and works, shall:

a related Commission implementing act, purchase only the products that comply with the criterion laid down in 
Article 7(2) of that Regulation;
(b) where a product not covered under point (a) is covered by an implementing measure under Directive 2009/125/EC, purchase only products that comply with energy efficiency benchmarks specified in that implementing measure;
(c) where a product or a service is covered by the Union green public procurement criteria or available equivalent national 
criteria, with relevance to energy efficiency of the product or service, make best efforts to purchase only products and 
services that respect at least the technical specifications set at ‘core’ level in the relevant Union green public

(e) require in their tenders for service contracts that service providers use, for the purposes of providing the services in 
question, only products that comply with points (a), (b) and (d), when providing the services in question. This 
requirement shall apply only to new products purchased by service providers partially or wholly for the purpose of 
providing the service in question;
(f) purchase, or make new rental agreements for, buildings that comply at least with nearly zero-energy level, without prejudice to Article 6 of this Directive, unless the purpose of the purchase is:
(i) to undertake deep renovation or demolition;
(ii) in the case of public bodies, to re-sell the building without using it for the public body’s own purposes; or
(iii) to preserve it as a building officially protected as part of a designated environment, or because of its special 
architectural or historic merit.
Compliance with the requirements laid down in point (f) of this Annex shall be verified by means of the energy 
performance certificates referred to in Article 11 of Directive 2010/31/EU.EN Official Journal of the European Union L 231/82 20.9.2023  ANNEX V 
COMMON METHODS AND PRINCIPLES FOR CALCULATING THE IMPACT OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY OBLIGATION 
SCHEMES OR OTHER POLICY MEASURES UNDER ARTICLES 8, 9 AND 10 AND ARTICLE 30(14) 
1. Methods for calculating energy savings other than those arising from taxation measures for the purposes of Articles 8, 
9 and 10 and Article 30(14).
Obligated, participating or entrusted parties, or implementing public authorities, may use the following methods for calculating energy savings:
(a) deemed savings, by reference to the results of previous independently monitored energy improvements in similar 
installations. The generic approach is termed ‘ex ante’;
(b) metered savings, whereby the savings from the installation of a measure, or package of measures, are determined 
by recording the actual reduction in energy use, taking due account of factors such as additionality, occupancy, production levels and the weather which may affect consumption. The generic approach is termed ‘ex post’;
(c) scaled savings, whereby engineering estimates of savings are used. This approach may be used only where establishing robust measured data for a specific installation is difficult or disproportionately expensive, for example replacing a compressor or electric motor with a different kWh rating from that for which independent 
information about savings has been measured, or where those estimates are carried out on the basis of nationally 
established methodologies and benchmarks by qualified or accredited experts that are independent of the obligated, participating or entrusted parties involved;
(d) when calculating the energy savings for the purpose of Article 8(3) that can be counted to fulfil the obligation in that Article, Member States may estimate the energy savings of people affected by energy poverty, vulnerable 
customers, people in low-income households and, where applicable, people living in social housing on the basis 
of engineering estimates using standardised occupancy and thermal comfort conditions or parameters, such as 
parameters defined in national building regulations. The way comfort is considered for actions in buildings should be reported by the Member States to the Commission together with explanations of their 
calculation methodology.
(e) surveyed savings, where consumers’ response to advice, information campaigns, labelling or certification schemes 
or smart metering is determined. This approach shall be used only for savings resulting from changes in consumer 
behaviour. It shall not be used for savings resulting from the installation of physical measures.
2. In determining the energy savings for an energy efficiency measure for the purposes of Articles 8, 9 and 10 and Article 30(14), the following principles apply:
(a) Member States shall demonstrate that one of the objectives of the policy measure, whether new or existing, is the 
achievement of end-use energy savings pursuant to Article 8(1) and shall provide evidence and their 
documentation showing that the energy savings are caused by a policy measure, including voluntary agreements;
(b) the savings shall be shown to be additional to those that would have occurred in any event without the activity of the obligated, participating or entrusted parties, or implementing public authorities. To determine the savings that can be claimed as additional, Member States shall have regard to how energy use and demand would evolve 
in the absence of the policy measure in question by taking into account at least the following factors: energy 
consumption trends, changes in consumer behaviour, technological progress and changes caused by other 
measures implemented at Union and national level;EN Official Journal of the European Union 20.9.2023 L 231/83  (c) savings resulting from the implementation of mandatory Union law shall be considered to be savings that would 
have occurred in any event, and thus shall not be claimed as energy savings for the purpose of Article 8(1). By 
way of derogation from that requirement, savings related to the renovation of existing buildings, including the savings resulting from the implementation of minimum energy performance standards in buildings in 
accordance with Directive 2010/31/EU, may be claimed as energy savings for the purpose of Article 8(1), 
provided that the materiality criterion referred to in point 3(h) of this Annex is ensured. Measures promoting energy efficiency improvements in the public sector pursuant to Article 5 and Article 6 may be eligible to be taken into account for the fulfilment of energy savings required under Article 8(1), provided that they result in 
verifiable and measurable or estimable end-use energy savings. The calculation of energy savings shall comply 
with this Annex;
(d) end-use energy savings resulting from the implementation of energy efficiency improvement measures taken 
pursuant to emergency regulations under Article 122 TFEU may be claimed for the purpose of Article 8(1), 
provided that they result in verifiable and measurable or estimable end-use energy savings, with the exception of 
those energy savings resulting from rationing or curtailment measures;
(e) measures taken pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/842 can be considered material, but Member States have to 
show that they result in verifiable and measurable or estimable end-use energy savings. The calculation of energy 
savings shall comply with this Annex;
(f) Member States shall count only end use energy savings from policy measures in sectors or installations covered 
by Chapter IVa of Directive 2003/87/EC if they result from the implementation of Article 9 or 10 of this 
Directive and which go beyond the requirements laid down in Directive 2003/87/EC or beyond the implementation of actions linked to the allocation of free allowances under that Directive. Member States shall 
demonstrate that the policy measures result in verifiable and measurable or estimable end-use energy savings. 
The calculation of energy savings shall comply with this Annex. If an entity is an obligated party under a 
national energy efficiency obligation scheme under Article 9 of this Directive and under the EU ETS for buildings and road transport under Chapter IVa of Directive 2003/87/EC, the monitoring and verification system shall ensure that the carbon price passed through when releasing fuel for consumption under that 
Chapter is taken into account when calculating and reporting the energy savings of its energy saving measures;
(g) credit may be given, provided that it is only given for savings exceeding the following levels:
(i) Union emission performance standards for new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles following 
the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2019/631 of the European Parliament and of the Council (
1); Member 
States must provide reasons, their assumptions and their calculation methodology to show additionality to 
the Union’s new vehicle CO 2 requirements;
(ii) Union requirements relating to the removal from the market of certain energy related products following the implementation of implementing measures under Directive 2009/125/EC. Member States shall provide 
evidence, their assumptions and their calculation methodology to show additionality;
(h) policies with the purpose of encouraging higher levels of energy efficiency of products, equipment, transport 
systems, vehicles and fuels, buildings and building elements, processes or markets shall be permitted, except for policy measures:
(i) regarding the use of direct combustion of fossil fuel technologies that are newly implemented as from 
1 January 2026; and
(ii) subsidising the use of direct combustion of fossil fuel technologies in residential buildings as from 1 January 
2026.

standards for new passenger cars and for new light commercial vehicles, and repealing Regulations (EC) No 443/2009 and (EU) 
No 510/2011 (OJ L 111, 25.4.2019, p. 13).EN Official Journal of the European Union L 231/84 20.9.2023  (i) energy savings as a result of policy measures newly implemented as from 1 January 2024 regarding the use of 
direct fossil fuel combustion in products, equipment, transport systems, vehicles, buildings or works shall not 
count towards the fulfilment of energy savings obligation pursuant to Article 8(1)(b). In the case of policy measures promoting combinations of technologies, the share of energy savings related to the fossil fuel 
combustion technology are not eligible as from 1 January 2024.
(j) by way of derogation from point (i), for the period 1 January 2024 to 31 December 2030, energy savings from 
direct fossil fuel combustion technologies improving the energy efficiency in energy intense enterprises in the 
industry sector may be counted as energy savings only for the purpose of Article 8(1), points (b) and (c), until 
31 December 2030, provided that:
(i) the enterprise has carried out an energy audit pursuant to Article 11(2) and an implementation plan 
including:
— an overview of all cost-effective energy efficiency measures with a payback period of five years or less, 
on the basis of simple pay-back period methodologies provided by the Member State,
— a timeframe for the implementation of all recommended energy efficiency measures with a payback 
period of five years or fewer,
— a calculation of expected energy savings resulting from the energy efficiency measures recommended, 
and
— energy efficiency measures related to the use of direct fossil fuel combustion technologies with the 
relevant information needed for:— proving that the measure identified does not increase the amount of energy needed or the capacity 
of an installation,
— justifying that the uptake of sustainable, non-fossil fuel technologies is technically not feasible,— showing that the direct fossil fuel combustion technology complies with the most up-to-date 
corresponding Union emission performance legislation and prevents technology lock-in effects by 
ensuring future compatibility with climate-neutral alternative non-fossil fuels and technologies.
(ii) the continuation of the use of direct fossil fuel technologies is an energy efficiency measure to decrease 
energy consumption with a payback period of five years or less, on the basis of simple pay-back period 
methodologies provided by the Member State, recommended as result of an energy audit pursuant to Article 11(2) and included in the implementation plan;
(iii) the use of direct fossil fuel technologies complies with the most up-to-date corresponding Union emission 
performance legislation, does not lead to technology lock-in effects and ensures future compatibility with 
climate-neutral alternative fuels and technologies;
(iv) the use of direct fossil fuel technologies in the enterprise does not lead to an increased energy consumption 
or increase the capacity of the installation in that enterprise;
(v) evidence is provided that no alternative, sustainable non-fossil fuel solution was technically feasible;
(vi) the use of direct fossil fuel technologies result in verifiable and measurable or estimable end-use energy savings calculated in accordance with this Annex;
(vii) evidence is published on a website or is made publicly available for all interested citizens;EN Official Journal of the European Union 20.9.2023 L 231/85  (k) measures promoting the installation of small-scale renewable energy technologies on or in buildings may be 
eligible to be taken into account for the fulfilment of energy savings required under Article 8(1), provided that 
they result in verifiable and measurable or estimable end-use energy savings. The calculation of energy savings 
shall comply with this Annex;
(l) measures promoting the installation of solar thermal technologies may be eligible to be taken into account for 
the fulfilment of energy savings required under Article 8(1) provided that they result in verifiable and 
measurable or estimable end-use energy savings. The heat produced by solar thermal technologies from solar radiation can be excluded from their end-use energy consumption;
(m) for policies that accelerate the uptake of more efficient products and vehicles, except those newly implemented as 
from 1 January 2024 regarding the use of direct fossil fuel combustion, full credit may be claimed, provided that 
it is shown that such uptake takes place before the expiry of the average expected lifetime of the product or 
vehicle, or before the product or vehicle would usually be replaced, and the savings are claimed only for the 
period until the end of the average expected lifetime of the product or vehicle to be replaced;
(n) in promoting the uptake of energy efficiency measures, Member States shall, where relevant, ensure that quality 
standards for products, services and installation of measures are maintained or introduced where such standards 
do not exist;
(o) to account for climatic variations between regions, Member States may choose to adjust the savings to a standard 
value or to accord different energy savings in accordance with temperature variations between regions;
(p) the calculation of energy savings shall take into account the lifetime of the measures and the rate at which the savings decline over time. That calculation shall count the savings each individual action will achieve during the 
period from its date of implementation to the end of each obligation period. Alternatively, Member States may 
adopt another method that is estimated to achieve at least the same total quantity of savings. When using another method, Member States shall ensure that the total amount of energy savings calculated using that 
method does not exceed the amount of energy savings that would have been the result of their calculation when 
counting the savings each individual action will achieve during the period from its date of implementation to 
2030. Member States shall describe in detail in their integrated national energy and climate plans notified 
pursuant to Article 3 and Articles 7 to 12 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 that other method and the provisions 
made to ensure that the binding calculation requirement is met.
3. Member States shall ensure that the following requirements for policy measures taken pursuant to Article 10 and Article 30(14) are met:
(a) policy measures and individual actions produce verifiable end-use energy savings;
(b) the responsibility of each participating party, entrusted party or implementing public authority, as relevant, is clearly defined;
(c) the energy savings that are achieved or are to be achieved are determined in a transparent manner;

energy consumption or final energy consumption, using the net calorific values or primary energy factors 
referred to in Article 31;
(e) an annual report on the energy savings achieved by entrusted parties, participating parties and implementing public authorities be provided and made publicly available, as well as data on the annual trend of energy savings;
(f) monitoring of the results and taking appropriate measures if progress is not satisfactory;
(g) the energy savings from an individual action are not claimed by more than one party;EN Official Journal of the European Union L 231/86 20.9.2023  (h) the activities of the participating party, entrusted party or implementing public authority are shown to be material 
to the achievement of the energy savings claimed;
(i) the activities of the participating party, entrusted party or implementing public authority have no adverse effects 
on people affected by energy poverty, vulnerable customers and, where applicable, people living in social housing.
4. In determining the energy savings from taxation-related policy measures introduced under Article 10, the following 
principles shall apply:
(a) credit shall be given only for energy savings from taxation measures exceeding the minimum levels of taxation 
applicable to fuels as required in Council Directive 2003/96/EC (2)or 2006/112/EC (3);
(b) short-run price elasticities for the calculation of the impact of the energy taxation measures shall represent the 
responsiveness of energy demand to price changes, and shall be estimated on the basis of recent and 
representative official data sources, which are applicable for the Member State, and, where applicable, on the 
basis of accompanying studies from an independent institute. If a different price elasticity than short-run 
elasticities is used, Member States shall explain how energy efficiency improvements due to the implementation of other Union legislation have been included in the baseline used to estimate the energy savings, or how a 
double-counting of energy savings from other Union legislation has been avoided;
(c) the energy savings from accompanying taxation policy instruments, including fiscal incentives or payment to a 
fund, shall be accounted separately;
(d) short-run elasticity estimates should be used to assess the energy savings from taxation measures to avoid overlap 
with Union law and other policy measures;
(e) Member States shall determine distributional effects of taxation and equivalent measures on people affected by 
energy poverty, vulnerable customers and, where applicable, people living in social housing, and show the effects 
of the mitigation measures implemented in accordance with Article 24(1), (2) and (3);
(f) Member States shall provide evidence, including calculation methodologies, that where there is an overlap in the 
impact of energy or carbon taxation measures or emissions trading in accordance with Directive 2003/87/EC, 
there is no double counting of energy savings.
5. Notification of methodology
Member States shall, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, notify to the Commission their proposed detailed methodology for the operation of the energy efficiency obligation schemes and alternative measures referred 
to in Articles 9 and 10, and Article 30(14) of this Directive. Except in the case of taxation, such notification shall 
include information on:

(a) industrial waste heat and cold;
(b) waste incineration;
(c) high efficiency cogeneration;
(d) renewable energy sources, such as geothermal, solar thermal and biomass, other than those used for high 
efficiency cogeneration;
(e) heat pumps;
(f) reducing heat and cold losses from existing district networks;
(g) district heating and cooling;
10. the analysis of economic potential shall include the following steps and considerations:
(a) Considerations:
(i) the cost-benefit analysis for the purposes of Article 25(3) shall include an economic analysis that takes into 
consideration socioeconomic and environmental factors (7), and a financial analysis performed to assess 
projects from the investors’ point of view, both economic and financial analyses using the net present value as a criterion for the assessment;
(ii) the baseline scenario should serve as a reference point and take into account existing policies at the time of compiling this comprehensive assessment (
8), and be linked to data collected under Part I and Part II, point 6 
of this Annex;
(6)The analysis of the economic potential should present the volume of energy (in GWh) that can be generated per year by each 
technology analysed. The limitations and interrelations within the energy system should also be taken into account. The analysis may 
make use of models based on assumptions representing the operation of common types of technologies or systems.

(8)The cut-off date for taking into account policies for the baseline scenario is the end of the year preceding to the year by the end of 
which the comprehensive assessment is due. That is to say, policies enacted within a year prior to the deadline for submission of the 
comprehensive assessment do not need to be taken into account.EN Official Journal of the European Union 20.9.2023 L 231/95  (iii) alternative scenarios to the baseline shall take into account energy efficiency and the renewable energy 
objectives of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, each scenario presenting the following elements compared to the 
baseline scenario:
— economic potential of technologies examined using the net present value as criterion;— GHG emission reductions;
— primary energy savings in GWh per year;
— impact on the share of renewables in the national energy mix.Scenarios that are not feasible due to technical reasons, financial reasons or national regulation may be 
excluded at an early stage of the cost-benefit analysis, if justified on the basis of careful, explicit and well- 
documented considerations.
The assessment and decision-making should take into account costs and energy savings from the increased 
flexibility in energy supply and from a more optimal operation of the electricity networks, including avoided costs and savings from reduced infrastructure investment, in the analysed scenarios.
(b) Costs and benefits
The costs and benefits referred to in point (a) shall include at least the following costs and benefits:(i) costs:— capital costs of plants and equipment;— capital costs of the associated energy networks;

(ii) benefits:
— value of output to the consumer (heating, cooling and electricity);
— external benefits such as environmental, greenhouse gas emissions and health and safety benefits, to the 
extent possible;
— labour market effects, energy security and competitiveness, to the extent possible.
(c) Relevant scenarios to the baseline:
All relevant scenarios to the baseline shall be considered, including the role of efficient individual heating and 
cooling. The cost-benefit analysis may cover either a project assessment or a group of projects for a broader local, 
regional or national assessment in order to establish the most cost-effective and beneficial heating or cooling 
solution against a baseline for a given geographical area for the purpose of planning.
(d) Boundaries and integrated approach:
(i) the geographical boundary shall cover a suitable, well-defined geographical area;
(ii) the cost-benefit analyses shall take into account all relevant centralised or decentralised supply resources 
available within the system and geographical boundary, including technologies considered under Part III, 
point 9, of this Annex, and heating and cooling demand trends and characteristics.
(e) Assumptions:
(i) Member States shall provide assumptions, for the purpose of the cost-benefit analyses, on the prices of major 
input and output factors and the discount rate;EN Official Journal of the European Union L 231/96 20.9.2023  (ii) the discount rate used in the economic analysis to calculate net present value shall be chosen according to 
European or national guidelines;
(iii) Member States shall use national, European or international energy price development forecasts, if 
appropriate, in their national, regional or local context;
(iv) the prices used in the economic analysis shall reflect socio-economic costs and benefits. External costs, such as environmental and health effects, should be included to the extent possible, namely when a market price 
exists or when it is already included in European or national regulation.
(f) Sensitivity analysis: a sensitivity analysis shall be included to assess the costs and benefits of a project or group of 
projects and be based on variable factors having a significant impact on the outcome of the calculations, such as 
different energy prices, levels of demand, discount rates and other.

Cost-benefit analyses shall be based on a description of the planned installation and the comparison installation(s), covering 
electrical and thermal capacity, as applicable, fuel type, planned usage and the number of planned operating hours every 
year, location and electricity and thermal demand.
An assessment of waste heat utilisation shall take into consideration current technologies. The assessment shall take into 
consideration the direct use of waste heat or its upgrading to higher temperature levels, or both. In the case of waste heat 
recovery on-site, at least the use of heat exchangers, heat pumps, and heat to power technologies shall be assessed. In the 
case of waste heat recovery off-site, at least industrial installations, agriculture sites and district heating networks shall be 
assessed as potential demand points.
For the purpose of the comparison, the thermal energy demand and the types of heating and cooling used by the nearby 
heat or cooling demand points shall be taken into account. The comparison shall cover infrastructure related costs for the 
planned and comparison installation.
Cost-benefit analyses for the purposes of Article 26(7) shall include an economic analysis covering a financial analysis 
reflecting actual cash flow transactions from investing in and operating individual installations.
Projects with positive cost-benefit outcome are those where the sum of discounted benefits in the economic and financial 
analysis exceeds the sum of discounted costs (cost-benefit surplus).
Member States shall set guiding principles for the methodology, assumptions and time horizon for the economic analysis.
Member States may require that the companies responsible for the operation of thermal electric generation installations, 
industrial companies, district heating and cooling networks, or other parties influenced by the defined system boundary 
and geographical boundary, contribute data for use in assessing the costs and benefits of an individual installation.EN Official Journal of the European Union L 231/98 20.9.2023  ANNEX XII

Since amendments made, Directive recast interests clarity. (2) In communication 17 September 2020 ‘Stepping Europe’s 2030 climate ambition – Investing climate-neutral future benefit people’ (the ‘Climate Target Plan’), Commission proposed raise Union’s climate ambition increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions target least 55 % 1990 levels 2030. That substantial increase compared existing 40 % reduction target. The proposal delivered commitment made communication Commission 11 December 2019 ‘The European Green Deal’ (the ‘European Green Deal’) put forward comprehensive plan increase Union’s target 2030 towards 55 % responsible way. It also accordance objectives Paris Agreement adopted 12 December 2015 United Nations Framework Convention Climate Change (the ‘Paris Agreement’) keep global temperature increase well 2 °C pursue efforts keep 1,5 °C.

(4)Directive 2012/27/EU European Parliament Council 25 October 2012 energy efficiency, amending Directives 2009/125/EC 2010/30/EU repealing Directives 2004/8/EC 2006/32/EC (OJ L 315, 14.11.2012, p. 1). (5)See Part A Annex XVI.EN Official Journal European Union 20.9.2023 L 231/1 (3) The conclusions European Council 10-11 December 2020 endorsed Union’s binding domestic reduction target net GHG emissions least 55 % 2030 compared 1990. The European Council concluded climate ambition needed raised manner would spur sustainable economic growth, create jobs, deliver health environmental benefits Union citizens, contribute long-term global competitiveness Union’s economy promoting innovation green technologies. (4) To implement objectives, Commission, communication 19 October 2020 ‘Commission Work Programme 2021 – A Union vitality world fragility’, announced legislative package reduce GHG emissions least 55 % 2030 (the ‘Fit 55 package’), achieve climate-neutral European Union 2050. That package covers range policy areas energy efficiency, renewable energy, land use, land change forestry, energy taxation, effort sharing emissions trading. (5) The purpose Fit 55 package safeguard create jobs Union enable Union become world leader development uptake clean technologies global energy transition, energy efficiency solutions. (6) Projections indicate that, full implementation current policies, GHG emission reductions 2030 would around 45 % compared 1990 levels, excluding land use emissions absorptions, around 47 %, them. The Climate Target Plan therefore provides set required actions across sectors economy revisions key legislative instruments reach increased climate ambition. (7) In communication 28 November 2018 ‘A Clean Planet – A European strategic long-term vision prosperous, modern, competitive climate neutral economy’, Commission stated energy efficiency key area action, without full decarbonisation Union’s economy cannot achieved. The need capture cost-effective energy saving opportunities led Union’s current energy efficiency policy. In December 2018, new 2030 Union headline energy efficiency target least 32,5 %, compared projected energy use 2030, included part Clean Energy All Europeans package, aimed putting energy efficiency first, achieving global leadership renewable energies providing fair deal consumers. (8) The impact assessment accompanying Climate Target Plan demonstrated that, achieve increased climate ambition, energy efficiency improvements need significantly raised current level 32,5 %. (9) An increase Union’s 2030 energy efficiency target reduce energy prices crucial reducing GHG emissions, accompanied increase uptake electrification, hydrogen, e-fuels relevant technologies necessary green transition, transport sector. Even rapid growth renewable electricity generation, energy efficiency reduce need new power generation capacity costs relating storage, transmission distribution. Increased energy efficiency also particularly important security energy supply Union, lowering Union’s dependence import fuels third countries. Energy efficiency one cleanest cost-efficient measures address dependence. (10) The sum national contributions communicated Member States national energy climate plans falls short Union’s target 32,5 %. The contributions would collectively lead reduction 29,7 % primary energy consumption 29,4 % final energy consumption compared projections Commission’s 2007 EU Reference Scenario 2030. That would translate collective gap 2,8 percentage points primary energy consumption 3,1 percentage points final energy consumption EU-27.EN Official Journal European Union L 231/2 20.9.2023 (11) A number Member States presented ambitious national energy climate plans, assessed Commission ‘sufficient’, contained measures allow Member States contribute reaching collective targets energy efficiency ratio larger Union average. In addition, number Member States documented ‘early efforts’ achieving energy savings, namely energy savings Union average trajectories last years. Both cases significant efforts recognised included Union’s future modelling projections serve good examples Member States work energy efficiency potential deliver significant benefits economies societies. (12) In cases, assumptions used Commission 2020 EU Reference Scenario assumptions used Member States reference scenarios underpinning national energy climate plans different. This may lead divergences regards calculation primary energy consumption approaches valid regard primary energy consumption. (13) While energy savings potential remains large sectors, particular challenge relating transport, responsible 30 % final energy consumption, buildings, since 75 % Union’s building stock poor energy performance. Another increasingly important sector information communications technology (ICT) sector, responsible 5 9 % world’s total electricity use 2 % global emissions. In 2018, data centres accounted 2,7 % electricity demand EU-28. In context, Commission, communication 19 February 2020 ‘Shaping Europe's digital future’ (the ‘Union’s Digital Strategy’), highlighted need highly energy-efficient sustainable data centres transparency measures telecoms operators regards environmental footprint. Furthermore, possible increase industry’s energy demand may result decarbonisation, particularly energy intensive processes, also taken account. (14) The higher level ambition requires stronger promotion cost-effective energy efficiency measures areas energy system relevant sectors activity affects energy demand, transport, water agriculture sectors. Improving energy efficiency throughout full energy chain, energy generation, transmission, distribution end-use, benefit environment, improve air quality public health, reduce GHG emissions, improve energy security decreasing need energy imports, particular fossil fuels, cut energy costs households companies, help alleviate energy poverty, lead increased competitiveness, jobs increased economic activity throughout economy. Improving energy efficiency would thus improve citizens’ quality life, contributing transformation Union’s energy relations third- country partners towards achieving climate neutrality. That complies Union commitments made framework Energy Union global climate agenda established Paris Agreement. Improving energy performance various sectors potential fostering urban regeneration, improvement buildings, changes mobility accessibility patterns, promoting efficient, sustainable affordable options. (15) This Directive takes step forward towards climate neutrality 2050, energy efficiency treated energy source right. The energy efficiency first principle overarching principle taken account across sectors, going beyond energy system, levels, financial sector. Energy efficiency solutions considered first option policy, planning investment decisions setting new rules supply side policy areas. While energy efficiency first principle applied without prejudice legal obligations, objectives principles, obligations, objectives principles hamper application lead exemptions applying principle. The Commission ensure energy efficiency demand response compete equal terms generation capacity. Energy efficiency improvements need made whenever cost-effective equivalent supply-side solutions. That help exploit multiple benefits energy efficiency Union, particular citizens businesses. Implementing energy efficiency improvement measures also priority alleviating energy poverty.EN Official Journal European Union 20.9.2023 L 231/3 (16) Energy efficiency recognised crucial element priority consideration future investment decisions Union’s energy infrastructure. The energy efficiency first principle applied taking consideration primarily system efficiency approach societal health perspective, paying attention security supply, energy system integration transition climate neutrality. Consequently, energy efficiency first principle help increase efficiency individual end-use sectors whole energy system. The application principle also support investments energy-efficient solutions contributing environmental objectives Regulation (EU) 2020/852 European Parliament Council ( 6). (17) The energy efficiency first principle provided Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 European Parliament Council ( 7)and core EU Strategy Energy System Integration established Commission’s communication 8 July 2022. While principle based cost-effectiveness, application wider implications societal perspective. Those implications vary depending circumstances carefully evaluated robust cost-benefit analysis methodologies take account multiple benefits energy efficiency. The Commission prepared dedicated guidelines operation application principle, proposing specific tools examples application various sectors. The Commission also issued recommendation Member States builds requirements laid Directive calls specific actions relation application principle. Member States take utmost account recommendation guided implementing energy efficiency principle practice. (18) The energy efficiency first principle implies adopting holistic approach, takes account overall efficiency integrated energy system, security supply cost effectiveness promotes efficient solutions climate neutrality across whole value chain, energy production, network transport final energy consumption, efficiencies achieved primary energy consumption final energy consumption. That approach look system performance dynamic use energy, demand- side resources system flexibility considered energy efficiency solutions. (19) In order impact, energy efficiency first principle needs consistently applied national, regional, local sectoral decision makers relevant scenarios policy, planning major investment decisions – say large-scale investments value EUR 100 000 000 EUR 175 000 000 transport infrastructure projects – affecting energy consumption supply. The proper application principle requires using right cost-benefit analysis methodology, setting enabling conditions energy efficient solutions proper monitoring. Cost-benefit analyses systematically developed carried out, based up-to-date information energy prices include scenarios rising prices, due decreasing Union’s emission trading system (EU ETS) allowances pursuant Directive 2003/87/EC European Parliament Council ( 8), order provide incentive apply energy efficiency measures. Priority given demand-side solutions cost-effective investments energy supply infrastructure meeting policy objectives.

THE EUR OPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUR OPEAN UNION, 
Having regar d to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 194(2) thereof, 
Having regar d to the proposal from the European Commission, 
After transmission of the draf t legislative act to the national parliaments, 
Having regar d to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committ ee (1), 
Having regar d to the opinion of the Committ ee of the Regions (2), 
Acting in accordance with the ordinar y legislative procedure (3), 
Whereas: 
(1)  Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) has been substantially amended several 
times (5). Since further amendments are to be made, that Directive should be recast in the interests of clarity. 
(2)  In accordance with Article 194(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), promoting 
renewable forms of energy is one of the goals of the Union energy policy . That goal is pursued by this Directive. 
The increased use of energy from renewable sources or ‘renewable energy’ constitutes an important part of the 
packag e of measures needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and compl y with the Union's commitment 
under the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change followi ng the 21st Conf erence of the Parties to the Unit ed 
Nations Framew ork Conv ention on Climate Change (the ‘Paris Agreement’), and with the Union 2030 energy and 
climat e framewor k, including the Union's binding target to cut emissions by at least 40 % below 1990 levels by 
2030. The Union's binding renewable energy targe t for 2030 and Member State s' contr ibutions to that targe t, 
including their baseline shares in relation to their national overall targe ts for 2020, are among the elements 
whic h have an overarch ing impor tance for the Union's energy and environmental policy . Other such elements are 
contained in the framework set out in this Directive, for instance, for the development of renewable heating and 
cooling and the development of renewable transpor t fuels. 
(3)  The increased use of energy from renewable sources also has a fundamental part to play in promoting the 
secur ity of energy supply , sustainable energy at affordable prices, technological development and inno vation as 
well as technological and industr ial leadership while provid ing environmental, social and health benefits as well 
as major oppor tunities for emplo yment and regional development, especially in rural and isolate d areas, in 
regions or territories with low population density or undergoing partial deindustr ialisation. 21.12.2018 L 328/82 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

(4)Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 Apr il 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from 
renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC (OJ L 140, 5.6.2009, p. 16). 
(5)See Annex X, Part A. (4)  In particular , reducing energy consum ption, increasing technological improvements, incentives for the use and 
expansion of public transpor t, the use of energy efficiency technologies and the promotion of the use of 
renewable energy in the electr icity sector, the heating and cooling sector and the transpor t sector are effective 
tools, together with energy efficiency measures, for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the Union and the 
Union's energy dependence. 
(5)  Directive 2009/28/EC established a regulator y framew ork for the promotion of the use of energy from renewable 
sources whic h set binding national target s on the share of renewable energy in energy consum ption and in the 
transpor t sector to be met by 2020. The Commission Communication of 22 Januar y 2014 entitled ‘A policy 
framew ork for climat e and energy in the period from 2020 to 2030’, established a framework for future Union 
energy and climat e policies and promoted a common understanding of how to develop those policies after 2020. 
The Commission proposed that the Union 2030 target for the share of renewable energy consumed in the Union 
should be at least 27 %. That proposal was endorsed by the European Council in its conclusions of 23 and 
24 October 2014, whic h indicated that Member States should be able to set their own, more ambitious, national 
target s in order to deliver their planned contr ibutions to the Union 2030 target and exceed them. 
(6)  In its resolutions of 5 Febr uary 2014 entitled ‘A 2030 framew ork for climate and energy policies ’ and of 23 June 
2016 entitled ‘The renewable energy progress repor t’, the European Parliament went further than the 
Commission proposal or the European Council conclusions, stressing that, in light of the Paris Agreement and 
the recent renewable technology cost reductions, it was desirable to be signif icantly more ambitious. 
(7)  The ambition set out in the Paris Agreement as well as technological developments, including cost reductions for 
investments in renewable energy , should theref ore be taken into account. 
(8)  It is thus appropr iate to establish a binding Union target of a share of at least 32 % of renewable energy . 
Moreover , the Commission should assess whether that target should be reviewed upwards in light of substantial 
cost reductions in the production of renewable energy , the Union's international commitments for decarboni ­
sation, or in the case of a significant decrease in energy consump tion in the Union. Member States should 
establish their contr ibution to the achi evement of that target as part of their integrated national energy and 
climat e plans pursuant to the governance process laid down in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European 
Parliament and of the Council (1). 
(9)  The establishment of a binding Union renewable energy target for 2030 would continue to encourag e the 
development of technologies which produce renewable energy and provi de certainty for investors. A target 
defined at Union level would leave greater flexibility for Member States to meet their greenhouse gas reduction 
target s in the most cost-effective manner in accordance with their specific circumstances, energy mix and 
capacity to produce renewable energy . 
(10)  In order to ensure consolidation of the results achieved under Directive 2009/28/EC, the national targets set for 
2020 should constitute Member States' minimum contr ibutions to the new 2030 framework. Under no circum ­
stances should the national shares of renewable energy fall below those contr ibutions. If they do, the relevant 
Member State s should take appropr iate measures as provided for in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 to ensure that 
that baseline share is regained. If a Member State does not maintain its baseline share over a 12-month period, it 
should, within 12 months of the end of that period, take additional measures to regai n that baseline share. 
Where a Member State has effectively take n such additional measures and has fulfilled its oblig ation to regai n the 
baseline share, it should be deemed to have complied with the mandatory baseline share requirements under this 
Directive and under Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 for the entire period in question. The Member State in question 
cannot theref ore be considered to have failed to fulfil its obligation to maintain its baseline share for the period 
in time where the gap occur red. Both the 2020 and 2030 frameworks serve the environmental and energy policy 
objectives of the Union. 
(11)  Member States should take additional measures in the event that the share of renewable energy at Union level 
does not meet the Union traject ory towards the renewable energy target of at least 32 %. Under Regulation (EU) 
2018/1999 the Commission may take measures at Union level in order to ensure achi evement of the target if an 
ambition gap is identified by the Commission during the assessment of the integrat ed national energy and 21.12.2018 L 328/83 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

Union and Climate Action, amending Regulations (EC) No 663/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 of the European Parliament and of the 
Council, Directives 94/22/EC, 98/70/EC, 2009/31/EC, 2009/73/EC, 2010/31/EU, 2012/27/EU and 2013/30/EU of the European

European Parliament and of the Council (see page 1 of this Official Jour nal). climat e plans. If the Commission identifies a deliver y gap during its assessment of the integra ted national energy 
and climate progress repor ts, Member State s should apply the measures provided for in Regulation (EU) 
2018/1999 to close that gap. 
(12)  In order to suppor t Member State s' ambitious contr ibutions to the Union target, a financial framework aiming to 
facilitate investments in renewable energy projects in those Member States should be established, including 
through the use of financial instr uments. 
(13)  The Commission should focus the allocation of funds on the reduction of the cost of capital of renewable energy 
projects since such cost has a mater ial impact on the cost of renewable energy projects and on their competi ­
tiveness, as well as on the development of essential infrastr ucture for an enhanced technically feasible and 
economically affordable uptak e of renewable energy such as transmission and distr ibution grid infrastr ucture, 
intelli gent netw orks and interconnections. 
(14)  The Commission should facilitat e the exchange of best practices between the compet ent national or regional 
author ities or bodies, for instance through regular meetings, to find a common approach to promote a higher 
uptak e of cost-efficient renewable energy projects. The Commission should also encourage investments in new , 
flexible and clean technologies, and establish an adequate strateg y to manage the retirement of technologies 
whic h do not contr ibute to the reduction of emissions or deliver suffi cient flexibility , based on transparent 
criteria and reliable mark et price signals. 
(15)  Regulation (EC) No 1099/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1), Directives 2001/77/EC (2) and 
2003/30/EC (3) of the European Parliament and of the Council, and Directive 2009/28/EC established definitions 
for diffe rent types of energy from renewable sources. Union law on the intern al market for energy establishes 
definitions for the electr icity sector in general . In the interests of clarity and legal certainty it is appropr iate to 
apply those definit ions in this Directive. 
(16)  Suppor t schem es for electr icity from renewable sources or ‘renewable electr icity’ have been demonstrated to be 
an effective way of fosteri ng deplo yment of renewable electr icity . If and when Member States decide to 
implement suppor t schemes, such suppor t should be provided in a form that is as non-distor tive as possible for 
the functioning of electr icity mark ets. To that end, an increasing number of Member State s allocat e suppor t in 
a form by means of whic h suppor t is grant ed in addition to mark et revenues and introduce mark et-based systems 
to determine the necessar y level of suppor t. Together with steps by whic h to make the mark et fit for increasing 
shares of renewable energy , such suppor t is a key element of increasing the mark et integrat ion of renewable 
electr icity , while taking into account the diffe rent capabilities of small and large producers to respond to mark et 
signals. 
(17)  Small-scale installations can be of great benefi t to increase public accept ance and to ensure the rollout of 
renewable energy projects, in particular at local level. In order to ensure participation of such small-scale instal ­
lations, specif ic conditions, including feed-in tariffs, might theref ore still be necessar y to ensure a positive cost- 
benefit ratio, in accordance with Union law relating to the electr icity market. The definition of small-scale instal ­
lations for the purposes of obtaining such suppor t is important to provide legal certainty for invest ors. State aid 
rules contain definitions of small-scale installations. 
(18)  Pursuant to Article 108 TFEU, the Commission has excl usive compet ence to assess the compatib ility of State aid 
measures with the intern al mark et which the Member States may put in place for deplo yment of energy from 
renewable sources. That assessment is carried out on the basis of Article 107(3) TFEU and in accordance with the 
relevant provis ions and guidelines which the Commission may adopt to that effect. This Directive is without 
prejudice to the Commission's exclusive compet ence grant ed by the TFEU. 
(19)  Electr icity from renewable sources should be deplo yed at the lowest possible cost to consumers and 
taxpa yers. When designing suppor t schemes and when allocating suppor t, Member States should seek to 21.12.2018 L 328/84 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

14.11.2008, p. 1). 
(2)Directive 2001/77/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 September 2001 on the promotion of electr icity produced 
from renewable energy sources in the internal electr icity market (OJ L 283, 27.10.2001, p. 33). 
(3)Directive 2003/30/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 May 2003 on the promotion of the use of biofuels or other 
renewable fuels for transpor t (OJ L 123, 17.5.2003, p. 42). minimise the overall system cost of deplo yment along the decarbonisation pathwa y towards the objective of 
a low-carbon econom y by the year 2050. Marke t-based mec hanisms, such as tenderi ng procedures, have been 
demonstrate d to reduce suppor t cost effectively in compet itive mark ets in man y circumstances. However , in 
specific circumstances, tender ing procedures may not necessar ily lead to efficient price disco very. Balanced 
exem ptions may theref ore need to be considered to ensure cost-effectiveness and minimise overall suppor t cost. 
In particular , Member States should be allowed to grant exem ptions from tenderi ng procedures and direct 
mark eting to small-scale installations and demonstration projects in order to take into account their more limite d 
capabilities. Since the Commission assesses the compatib ility of suppor t for renewable energy with the internal 
mark et on a case-by-case basis, such exem ptions should compl y with the relevant thresholds set out in the latest 
Commission Guidelines on State aid for envi ronmental protect ion and energy . In the Guidelines for 2014 to 
2020, those thresholds are set at 1 MW (and 6 MW or 6 generation units for wind energy) and 500 kW (and 
3 MW or 3 generation units for wind energy) in term s of exem ptions from, respectively , tendering procedures 
and direct mark eting. To increase the effectiveness of tendering procedures to minimise overall suppor t costs, 
tendering procedures should, in principle, be open to all producers of electr icity from renewable sources on 
a non-discr iminato ry basis. While Member State s develop their suppor t schem es, they may limit tendering 
procedures to specifi c technologies where this is needed to avoid sub-optim al results with regar d to netw ork 
constraints and grid stability , syste m integration costs, the need to achi eve diversif ication of the energy mix, and 
the long-t erm poten tial of technologies. 
(20)  In its conclusions of 23 and 24 Octobe r 2014 on the ‘2030 Climate and Energy Policy Framew ork’, the European 
Council stressed the importance of a more inter connected internal energy market and the need for suffi cient 
suppor t to integrat e ever increasing levels of variable renewable energy and thus allow the Union to fulfil its 
leadership ambitions for the energy transition. It is theref ore important and urgent to increase the level of 
inter connection and to make progress towards the European Council's objectives, in order to maximise the 
Energy Union' s full potential. 
(21)  When developing suppor t schemes for renewable sources of energy , Member State s should consider the available 
sustainable supply of biomass and take due account of the principles of the circular economy and of the waste 
hierarc hy established in Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (1) in order to 
avoid unnecessar y distor tions of raw mater ials mark ets. Waste prevention and recy cling of waste should be the 
priority option. Member States should avoid creating suppor t sche mes which would be counte r to targets on 
treatment of wast e and whic h would lead to the ineffi cient use of recy clable waste. 
(22)  Member States have differ ent renewable energy poten tials and operat e diffe rent suppor t schem es at national level. 
The majority of Member States apply suppor t schemes that grant benefits solely to energy from renewable 
sources that is produced on their territory. For the proper functioning of national suppor t schem es, it is vital that 
Member States continue to be able to control the effect and costs of their national suppor t schemes in 
accordance with their diffe rent poten tials. One important means by which to achieve the aim of this Directive 
remains to guarantee the proper functioning of national suppor t schemes under Directives 2001/77/EC and 
2009/28/EC, in order to maintain invest or conf idence and allow Member States to design effective national 
measures for their respective contr ibutions to the Union's 2030 target for renewable energy and for the national 
target s that they have set for themselves. This Directive should facilitat e cross-border suppor t for renewable 
energy without affecting national suppor t schemes in a dispropor tionate manner . 
(23)  The opening of suppor t sche mes to cross-border participation limits negative impacts on the internal energy 
mark et and can, under certain conditions, help Member States achieve the Union target more cost-effi ciently . 
Cross-border participation is also the natural corollar y to the development of the Union renewable energy policy , 
foste ring conver gence and cooperation to contr ibute to the Union's binding target. It is theref ore appropr iate to 
encourag e Member States to open suppor t to projects locat ed in other Member State s, and define several ways in 
whic h such progressive opening may be implemented, ensur ing compliance with the TFEU, in particular 
Articles 30, 34 and 110 thereof. As electr icity flows cannot be traced, it is appropr iate to link the opening of 
suppor t schem es to cross-border participation to shares representing an aspiration towards actual levels of 
physical inter connection and to allow Member State s to restr ict their open suppor t schemes to Member States 
with which they have a direct netw ork connection as a practical proxy for demonstrating the existen ce of 
physical flows between the Member States. This should not, however , in any way affect the cross-zonal or cross- 
border functioning of the electr icity markets. 21.12.2018 L 328/85 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     
(1)Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 on waste and repealing certain Directives 
(OJ L 312, 22.11.2008, p. 3). (24)  In order to ensure that the opening of suppor t schemes is reciprocal and brings mutual benefits, cooperation 
agreements should be signed between participating Member State s. Member States should retain control over the 
pace of deplo yment of renewable electr icity capacity on their territory in order , in particular , to take account of 
associated integration costs and required grid investments. Member State s should thus be allowe d to limit the par­
ticipation of installations locat ed on their territory to tenders opened to them by other Member States. Those 
cooperation agreements should address all relevant aspects, such as accounting for costs relating to a project built 
by one Member State on the territory of another , including the expenditure relating to strengthening netw orks, 
energy transfer , storag e and back -up capacity , as well as possible cong estions in the netw ork. In those agreements 
Member States should also take into account measures that may allow for the cost-effe ctive integration of such 
additional renewable electr icity capacity , whether they are of a regulatory nature (for instance related to mark et 
design) or provide for additional inve stments in various sources of flexibility (for instance interconnections, 
storage, demand response or flexible generation). 
(25)  Member States should avoid distor tive situations resulting in the extensive importation of resources from third 
countr ies. A life-cy cle approach should be considered and promot ed in that respect. 
(26)  Member States should ensure that renewable energy communities can participat e in available suppor t schemes on 
an equal footing with large participants. To that end, Member State s should be allowed to take measures, such as 
provid ing information, provi ding technical and financial suppor t, reducing administrative requirements, including 
community-f ocused bidding criteria, creating tailored bidding windows for renewable energy communities, or 
allowing renewable energy communities to be remunerate d through direct suppor t where they comply with 
requirements of small installations. 
(27)  The planning of the infrastr ucture needed for the production of electr icity from renewable sources should take 
into account policies relating to the participation of those affected by the projects, in particular local populations. 
(28)  Consumers should be provid ed with compr ehensive information, including information on the energy 
performa nce of heating and cooling systems and on the lowe r running costs of electr ic vehicles, to allow them to 
make individual consumer choices with regar d to renewable energy and avoid technology lock-in. 
(29)  Without prejudice to Articles 107 and 108 TFEU, policies suppor ting renewable energy should be predictable 
and stable and should avoid frequent or retroactive chang es. Policy unpredictabi lity and instability have a direct 
impact on capital financing costs, on the costs of project development and theref ore on the overall cost of 
deplo ying renewable energy in the Union. Member States should prevent the revision of any suppor t grant ed to 
renewable energy projects from having a negative impact on their economic viability . In that cont ext, 
Member States should promote cost-effective suppor t policies and ensure their financial sustainability . Moreover , 
a long-ter m indicative sched ule covering the main aspects of the expected suppor t should be published, without 
affecting the ability of Member States to decide on budget allocation in the years covered by the schedule. 
(30)  Member States' oblig ations to draf t renewable energy action plans and progress repor ts and the Commission's 
oblig ation to repor t on Member States' progress are essential in order to increase transparency , provid e clarity to 
investors and consumers and allow for effective monitori ng. Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 integrates those 
oblig ations in the Energy Union governance system , where planning, repor ting and monitoring oblig ations in the 
energy and climat e fields are streamlined. The transparency platf orm on renewable energy is also integrat ed in 
the broader e-platf orm established in that Regulation. 
(31)  It is necessar y to provide for transparent and unambiguous rules for calculating the share of energy from 
renewable sources and for defining those sources. 
(32)  In calculating the contr ibution of hydropowe r and wind power for the purposes of this Directive, the effects of 
climatic variation should be smoothed through the use of a normalisation rule. Further , electr icity produced in 
pumpe d storage units from water that has previously been pumpe d uphill should not be considered to be 
renewable electr icity . 21.12.2018 L 328/86 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     (33)  In order to function, heat pumps enabling the use of ambient and geother mal energy at a useful temperature 
level or systems provid ing cooling need electr icity or other auxiliar y energy . The energy used to drive those 
system s should theref ore be deducted from the total usable energy or energy removed from the area. Only 
heating and cooling syste ms where the output or energy remo ved from an area signif icantly exceed s the primar y 
energy needed to drive them should be take n into account. Cooling systems contr ibute to energy use in 
Member States and it is theref ore appropr iate that the calculation methods take into account the share of 
renewable energy used in such systems in all end-use sectors. 
(34)  Passive energy systems use building design to harness energy . This is considered to be saved energy . To avoid 
double counting, energy harnessed in this way should not be take n into account for the purposes of this 
Directive. 
(35)  Some Member States have a large share of aviation in their gross final consum ption of energy . In view of the 
current technological and regulator y constraints that prevent the commercial use of biofuels in aviation, it is 
theref ore appropr iate to provide those Member States with a partial exem ption within the calculation of the gross 
final consump tion of energy in the national air transpor t sector in order to allow them to exclude from that 
calculation the amount by which they exceed one-and-a-half times the Union average gross final consum ption of 
energy in aviation in 2005, as assessed by Eurostat, namely , 6,18 %. Due to their insular and peripheral charact er, 
Cypr us and Malta rely in particular on aviatio n as a mode of transpor t, which is essential for their citizens and 
their econom y. As a result, their gross final consump tion of energy in the national air transpor t sector is dispro ­
portionally high, namely , more than three times the Union average in 2005. They are thus dispropor tionate ly 
affected by the current technological and regulator y constraints. It is theref ore appropr iate to provi de that they 
benefit from an exem ption covering the amount by whic h they exceed the Union average gross final 
consum ption of energy in aviation in 2005 as assessed by Eurostat, namely , 4,12 %. 
(36)  The communication of the Commission of 20 July 2016 entitled ‘A European Strategy for Low-Emissi on 
Mobility’, highlight ed the particular importance, in the medium term , of advanced biofuels and renewable liquid 
and gaseous fuels of non-biological origin for aviatio n. 
(37)  In order to ensure that the list of feedstoc k to produce advanced biofuels, other biofuels and biogas , as set out in 
an annex to this Directive, takes into account the principles of the waste hierarc hy established in 
Directive 2008/98/EC, the Union sustainability criteria, and the need to ensure that that annex does not creat e 
additional demand for land while promoting the use of waste s and residues, the Commission, when regularly 
evaluating that annex, should consider the inclusion of additional feedst ock that does not cause significant 
distor tive effects on mark ets for (by-)products, wastes or residues. 
(38)  To creat e oppor tunities for reducing the cost of meeting the Union target laid down in this Directive and to give 
flexibility to Member States to compl y with their obligation not to fall below their 2020 national target s after 
2020, it is appropr iate both to facilitate the consump tion in Member States of energy produced from renewable 
sources in other Member States, and to enable Member States to count energy from renewable sources consumed 
in other Member States towards their own renewable energy share. For that reason, the Commission should put 
in place a Union renewable development platf orm (‘URDP’), enabling trading renewable energy shares between 
Member State s, in addition to bilate ral cooperation agreements. The URDP is intended to compl ement the 
voluntar y opening of suppor t sche mes to projects locat ed in other Member States. The agreements between 
Member States include statistical transfers, joint projects between Member State s or joint suppor t schemes. 
(39)  Member States should be encourag ed to pursue all appropr iate forms of cooperation in relation to the objectives 
set out in this Directive and to inform citizens about the benefits stemming from the use of cooperation 
mech anisms. Such cooperation can take place at all levels, bilate rally or multilaterally . Apar t from the 
mech anisms which have an effect on target renewable energy share calculation and target compliance, and whic h 
are exclusively provided for in this Directive, namely statistical transfer s between Member States –whether put in 
place bilat erally or through the URDP – joint projects and joint suppor t sche mes, cooperation can also take the 
form of, for example, exchange s of information and best practices, as provided for, in particular , in the e-platf orm 
established by Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, and other voluntar y coordination between all types of suppor t 
sche mes. 21.12.2018 L 328/87 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     (40)  It should be possible for imported electr icity produced from renewable sources outside the Union to count 
towards Member States' renewable energy shares. In order to guarant ee an adequate effect of renewable energy 
replacing non-renewable energy in the Union as well as in third countr ies, it is appropr iate to ensure that such 
imports can be tracked and accounted for in a reliable way. Agreements with third countr ies concer ning the 
organisation of such trade in renewable electr icity will be considered. If, by virtue of a decision taken under the 
Energy Community Treaty (1) to that effect, the contracting parties thereto are bound by the relevant provisions 
of this Directive, the measures of cooperation between Member States provided for in this Directive should be 
applicable to them. 
(41)  When Member States under take joint projects with one or more third countr ies rega rding the production of 
renewable electr icity , it is appropr iate that those joint projects relat e only to newly constr ucted installations or to 
installations with newly increased capacity . This will help ensure that the propor tion of energy from renewable 
sources in the third countr y's total energy consump tion is not reduced due to the importation of energy from 
renewable sources into the Union. 
(42)  In addition to establishing a Union framew ork for the promotion of energy from renewable sources, this 
Directive also contr ibutes to the poten tial positive impact which the Union and the Member States can have in 
boosting the development of the renewable energy sector in third countr ies. The Union and the Member States 
should promote researc h, development and inve stment in the production of renewable energy in developing and 
other partner countr ies while fully respecting international law, thereby strengthening their environmental and 
economic sustainability and their expor t capacity of renewable energy . 
(43)  The procedure used for the author isation, certification and licensing of renewable energy plants should be 
objective, transparent, non-discr iminato ry and propor tionate when applying the rules to specifi c projects. In 
particular , it is appropr iate to avoid any unnecessar y burden that could arise by classifying renewable energy 
projects under installations whic h represent a high risk to health. 
(44)  For the benefit of the rapid deplo yment of energy from renewable sources and in view of their overall high 
sustainable and environmental beneficial quality , Member States should, when applying administrative rules or 
planning structures and legislation whic h are designed for licensing installations with respect to pollution 
reduction and control of industr ial plants, for combating air pollution, or for the prevention or minimisation of 
the disc harge of dange rous substances in the environment, take into account the contr ibution of energy from 
renewable sources towards meeting environmental and climate change objectives, in particular when compare d 
to non-renewable energy installations. 
(45)  The coherence between the objectives of this Directive and the Union's other environmental law should be 
ensured. In particular , during assessment, planning or licensing procedures for renewable energy installations, 
Member States should take account of all Union envi ronmental law and the contr ibution made by energy from 
renewable sources towards meeting environmental and climate change objectives, in particular when compare d 
to non-renewable energy installations. 
(46)  Geother mal energy is an impor tant local renewable energy source whic h usually has considerably lower 
emissions than fossil fuels, and certain types of geother mal plants produce near -zero emission. Howe ver, 
depending on the geological charact eristics of an area, the production of geother mal energy may release 
greenhouse gases and other substances from underground fluids, and other subsoil geological formations, which 
are harmful for health and the environment. The Commission should theref ore facilitate only the deplo yment of 
geother mal energy with a low environmental impact and resulting in greenhouse gas emissions savings compar ed 
to non-renewable sources. 
(47)  At national, regional and where applicable local level, rules and oblig ations for minimum requirements for the 
use of energy from renewable sources in new and renova ted buildings have led to considerable increases in the 
use of energy from renewable sources. Those measures should be encouraged in a wider Union cont ext, while 
promoting the use of more energy-efficien t applications of energy from renewable sources in combination with 
energy-sa vings and energy-eff iciency measures through building regulations and codes. 21.12.2018 L 328/88 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     
(1)OJ L 198, 20.7.2006, p. 18. (48)  In order to facilita te and accelerat e the setting of minimum levels for the use of energy from renewable sources in 
buildings, the calculation of those minimum levels in new and existing buildings subject to major renov ation 
should provide a suffi cient basis for assessing whether the inclusion of minimum levels of renewable energy is 
technically , functionally and economically feasible. Member States should allow, inter alia, the use of efficient 
distr ict heating and cooling or, where distr ict heating and cooling syste ms are not available, other energy 
infrastr ucture to fulfil those requirements. 
(49)  To ensure that national measures for developing renewable heating and cooling are based on compre hensive 
mapping and analysis of the national renewable and waste energy potential and that such measures provid e for 
increased integration of renewable energy , by suppor ting, inter alia, innovative technologies such as heat pumps , 
geother mal and solar ther mal technologies, and waste heat and cold, it is appropr iate to require that 
Member State s carry out an assessment of their poten tial of energy from renewable sources and the use of waste 
heat and cold in the heating and cooling sector , in particular to promot e energy from renewable sources in 
heating and cooling installations and promote competitive and efficient distr ict heating and cooling. To ensure 
consiste ncy with energy efficiency requirements for heating and cooling and reduce administrative burden, that 
assessment should be included in the comprehensive assessments carried out and notified in accordance with 
Article 14 of Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (1). 
(50)  The lack of transparent rules and coordination between the different author isation bodies has been shown to 
hinder the deplo yment of energy from renewable sources. Prov iding guidance to applicants throughout their 
administrative permit application and granting processes by means of an administrative contact point is intende d 
to reduce compl exity for project developers and increase efficiency and transparency , including for renewables 
self-consumers and renewable energy communities. Such guidance is to be provided at an appropr iate level of 
governance, taking into account the specifi cities of Member States. The sing le contact points should guide the 
applicant and facilitat e through the entire administrative process so that the applicant is not oblig ed to contact 
other administrative bodies in order to complet e the permit-granting process, unless the applicant prefers to 
do so. 
(51)  Lengthy administrative procedures constitute a major administrative barrier and are costly . The simplification of 
administrative permit granting processes, and clear time-limits for decisions to be taken by the author ities 
compet ent for issuing the author isation for the electr icity generation installation on the basis of a compl eted 
application, should stimulate a more efficient handling of procedures, thereby reducing administrative costs. A 
manual of procedures should be made available to facilitate the understanding of procedures for project 
developers and citizens wishing to invest in renewable energy . In order to foster the uptak e of renewable energy 
by microent erprises and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and individual citizens, in accordance with 
the objectives set out in this Directive, a simple-notifi cation procedure for grid connections to the compet ent 
body should be established for small renewable energy projects, including those that are decentralised, such as 
roof top solar installations. In order to respond to the increasing need for the repower ing of existing renewable 
energy plants, streamlined permit-granting procedures should be provid ed for. This Directive, in particular the 
provis ions on the organisation and duration of the administrative permit granting process, should apply without 
prejudice to intern ational and Union law, including provi sions to prote ct the environment and human health. 
Where duly justif ied on the grounds of extraordinar y circumstances, it should be possible to extend the initial 
timeframes by up to one year. 
(52)  Information and training gaps, especially in the heating and cooling sector, should be remo ved in order to 
encourag e the deplo yment of energy from renewable sources. 
(53)  In so far as the access or pursuit of the profess ion of installer is a regulated profess ion, the preconditions for the 
recognition of profe ssional qualif ications are laid down in Directive 2005/36/EC of the European Parliament and 
of the Council (2). This Directive theref ore applies without prejudice to Directive 2005/36/EC. 21.12.2018 L 328/89 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     
(1)Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on energy efficiency , amending Directives 
2009/125/EC and 2010/30/EU and repealing Directives 2004/8/EC and 2006/32/EC (OJ L 315, 14.11.2012, p. 1). 
(2)Directive 2005/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on the recognition of professio nal qualifi ­
cations (OJ L 255, 30.9.2005, p. 22). (54)  While Directive 2005/36/EC lays down requirements for the mutual recognition of professional qualifications, 
including for arch itects, there is also a need to ensure that planners and arch itects properly consider an optimal 
combination of renewable energy and high-efficiency technologies in their plans and designs. Member States 
should theref ore provid e clear guidance in that regar d. This should be done without prejudice to that Directive 
and in particular Articles 46 and 49 thereof. 
(55)  Guarant ees of origin issued for the purposes of this Directive have the sole function of showi ng to a final 
custome r that a given share or quantity of energy was produced from renewable sources. A guarantee of origin 
can be transferr ed, independently of the energy to whic h it relat es, from one holder to another . However , with 
a view to ensur ing that a unit of renewable energy is disclosed to a customer only once, double counting and 
double disclosure of guarant ees of origin should be avoided. Energy from renewable sources in relation to which 
the accompan ying guarantee of origin has been sold separately by the producer should not be disclosed or sold 
to the final custome r as energy from renewable sources. It is impor tant to distinguish between green certificates 
used for suppor t schemes and guarant ees of origin. 
(56)  It is appropr iate to allow the consumer market for renewable electr icity to contr ibut e to the development of 
energy from renewable sources. Member States should theref ore require electr icity suppliers who disclose their 
energy mix to final customers pursuant to Union law on the internal market for electr icity , or who market energy 
to consumers with a reference to the consump tion of energy from renewable sources, to use guarant ees of origin 
from installations producing energy from renewable sources. 
(57)  It is impor tant to provi de information on how suppor ted electr icity is allocat ed to final customers. In order to 
improve the quality of that information to consumers, Member State s should ensure that guarantees of origin are 
issued for all units of renewable energy produced, exce pt where they decide not to issue guarant ees of origin to 
producers that also receive financial suppor t. If Member States decide to issue guarantees of origin to producers 
that also receive financial suppor t or not to issue guarant ees of origin directly to producers, they should be able 
to choose by which means and mechani sms to take into account the market value of those guarantees of origin. 
Where renewable energy producers also receive financial suppor t, the mark et value of the guarant ees of origin 
for the same production should be appropr iately taken into account in the relevant suppor t sche me. 
(58)  Directive 2012/27/EU provid es for guarantees of origin for proving the origin of electr icity produced from high- 
efficiency cogeneration plants. However , no use is specified for such guarantees of origin, so their use may also 
be enabled when disclosing the use of energy from high-eff iciency cogeneration. 
(59)  Guarant ees of origin whic h are currently in place for renewable electr icity should be exte nded to cover renewable 
gas. Extending the guarant ees of origin system to energy from non-renewable sources should be an option for 
Member States. This would provi de a consistent means of proving to final custome rs the origin of renewable gas 
such as biomethane and would facilitat e greate r cross-border trade in such gas. It would also enable the creation 
of guarant ees of origin for other renewable gas such as hydrogen. 
(60)  There is a need to suppor t the integration of energy from renewable sources into the transmission and 
distr ibution grid and the use of energy storag e systems for integrat ed variable production of energy from 
renewable sources, in particular as regar ds the rules regulating dispatch and access to the grid. The framew ork for 
the integration of renewable electr icity is provid ed for in other Union law relating to the intern al electr icity 
mark et. Howe ver, that framew ork does not include provis ions on the integration of gas from renewable sources 
into the gas grid. It is theref ore necessar y to include such provi sions in this Directive. 
(61)  The oppor tunities for establishing economic growth through inno vation and a sustainable compe titive energy 
policy have been recognised. Production of energy from renewable sources often depends on local or regional 
SMEs. The oppor tunities for local business development, sustainable growth and high-quality emplo yment that 
investments in regional and local production of energy from renewable sources bring about in the Member States 
and their regions are impor tant. The Commission and the Member State s should theref ore foster and suppor t 21.12.2018 L 328/90 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     national and regional development measures in those areas, encourage the exchange of best practices in 
production of energy from renewable sources between local and regional development initiatives and enhance the 
provis ion of technical assistance and training programmes, in order to strengthen regulatory , technical and 
financia l exper tise and foster knowledg e on available funding possibilities, including a more target ed use of Union 
funds, such as the use of cohesion policy funding in that area. 
(62)  Regional and local author ities often set more ambitious renewable targets that exce ed national targe ts. Regional 
and local commitments to stimulating development of renewable energy and energy efficiency are currently 
suppor ted through netw orks, such as the Covenant of Mayors, Smar t Cities or Smar t Communities initiatives, 
and the development of sustainable energy action plans. Such netw orks are essential and should be expanded, as 
they raise awar eness and facilita te exchange s of best practices and available financia l suppor t. In that conte xt, the 
Commission should suppor t interest ed innovati ve regions and local author ities to work across borders by 
assisting in setting up cooperation mechani sms, such as the European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation, which 
enables public author ities of various Member States to collaborate and deliver joint services and projects, without 
requir ing a prior intern ational agreement to be signed and ratified by national parliaments. Other innovative 
measures to attract more inve stment into new technologies, such as energy-perf ormance contracts and standardis ­
ation processes in public financing, should also be considered. 
(63)  When favouring the development of the mark et for energy from renewable sources, it is necessar y to take into 
account the positive impact on regional and local development oppor tunities, expor t prospects, social cohesion 
and emplo yment oppor tunities, in particular as concer ns SMEs and independent energy producers, including 
renewables self-consumers and renewable energy communities. 
(64)  The specif ic situation of the outermost regions is recognised in Article 349 TFEU. The energy sector in the 
outermost regions is often charact erised by isolation, limited supply and dependence on fossil fuels while those 
regions benefit from significant local renewable sources of energy . The outer most regions could thus serve as 
examp les of the application of inno vative energy technologies for the Union. It is theref ore necessar y to promot e 
the uptak e of renewable energy in order to achi eve a higher degree of energy autonom y for those regions and 
recognise their specific situation in term s of renewable energy poten tial and public suppor t needs. Provisio n 
should be made for a derog ation of limited local impa ct that allows Member State s to adopt specifi c criteria in 
order to ensure eligibility for financial suppor t for the consum ption of certain biomass fuels. Member States 
should be able to adopt such specifi c criteria for installations using biomass fuels and located in an outermost 
region as refer red to in Article 349 TFEU, as well as for biomass that is used as fuel in such installations and that 
does not compl y with the harmonised sustainability , energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions saving 
criteria set out in this Directive. Such specif ic criteria for biomass fuels should apply irrespective of whether the 
place of origin of that biomass is a Member State or a third countr y. Moreover , any specifi c criteria should be 
objectively justified on the grounds of energy independence of the outermost region concer ned and of ensur ing 
a smooth transition to the sustainability criteria, the energy efficiency criteria and the greenhouse gas emissions 
saving criteria for biomass fuels of this Directive in such an outermost region. 
Consider ing that the energy mix for electr icity generation for the outer most regions is made up to a large extent 
of fuel oil, it is necessar y to allow an appropr iate consideration of greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria in 
those regions. It would theref ore be appropr iate to provide for a specific fossil fuel compar ator for the electr icity 
produced in the outermost regions. Member State s should ensure effective compl iance with their specifi c criteria. 
Finally , Member States should, without prejudice to suppor t grant ed in accordance with suppor t schemes in 
accordance with this Directive, not refuse to take into account, on other sustainability grounds, biofuels and 
bioliquids obtained in accordance with this Directive. This prohibition is intended to ensure that biofuels and 
bioliquids that compl y with the harmonised criteria provided for in this Directive continue to benefit from the 
trade facilitation objectives of this Directive, including as regar ds the outermost regions concer ned. 
(65)  It is appropr iate to allow for the development of decentralised renewable energy technologies and storag e under 
non-discr iminato ry conditions and without hamp ering the financing of infrastr ucture inve stments. The mov e 
towards decentralised energy production has many benefits, including the utilisation of local energy sources, 
increased local secur ity of energy supply , shor ter transpor t distances and reduced energy transmission 
losses. Such decentralisation also foste rs community development and cohesion by provid ing income sources and 
creating jobs locally . 21.12.2018 L 328/91 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     (66)  With the growing impor tance of self-consump tion of renewable electr icity , there is a need for a definition of 
‘renewables self-consumers’ and of ‘jointly acting renewables self-consumers’. It is also necessar y to establish 
a regulatory framework which would empower renewables self-consumers to generate , consume, store , and sell 
electr icity without facing dispropor tionate burdens. Citizens living in apar tments for exam ple should be able to 
benefit from consumer empo werment to the same exte nt as households in sing le family homes. Howe ver, 
Member States should be allowed to differentiat e between individual renewables self-consumers and jointly acting 
renewables self-consumers due to their differ ent charact eristics to the extent that any such diffe rentiation is 
propor tionate and duly justif ied. 
(67)  Empo wering jointly acting renewables self-consumers also provides oppor tunities for renewable energy 
communities to advance energy efficiency at household level and helps fight energy pover ty through reduced 
consum ption and lowe r supply tariffs. Member States should take appropr iate advantage of that oppor tunity by, 
inter alia, assessing the possibility to enable participation by households that might other wise not be able to 
participat e, including vulnerable consumers and tenants. 
(68)  Renewables self-consumers should not face discr iminato ry or dispropor tionate burdens or costs and should not 
be subject to unjustified charg es. Their contr ibution to the achi evement of the climat e and energy target and the 
costs and benefi ts that they bring about in the wider energy system should be taken into account. Member States 
should theref ore general ly not apply charges to electr icity produced and consumed within the same premises by 
renewables self-consumers. However , Member States should be allowed to apply non-discr iminato ry and propor ­
tionate charg es to such electr icity if necessar y to ensure the financial sustainability of the electr icity syste m, to 
limit the suppor t to what is objectively needed and to make efficient use of their suppor t schemes. At the same 
time, Member States should ensure that renewables self-consumers contr ibute in a balanced and adequate way to 
the overall cost-shar ing system of producing, distr ibuting and consuming electr icity , when electr icity is fed into 
the grid. 
(69)  To that end, Member States should as a general principle not apply charges to electr icity individually produced 
and consumed by renewables self-consumers within the same premises. However , in order to prevent that 
incentive from affecting the financia l stability of suppor t sche mes for renewable energy , that incentive could be 
limited to small installations with an electr ical capacity of 30 kW or less. In certain cases, Member States should 
be allowed to apply charges to renewables self-consumers for self-consumed electr icity , where they make efficient 
use of their suppor t schemes and apply non-discr iminato ry and effective access to their suppor t 
sche mes. Member States should also be able to apply partial exem ptions from charges , levies, or a combination 
thereof and suppor t, up to the level needed to ensure the economic viability of such projects. 
(70)  The participation of local citizens and local author ities in renewable energy projects through renewable energy 
communities has result ed in substantial added value in term s of local acceptance of renewable energy and access 
to additional private capital which results in local investment, more choice for consumers and greater participa ­
tion by citizens in the energy transition. Such local involvement is all the more crucial in a context of increasing 
renewable energy capacity . Measures to allow renewable energy communities to compet e on an equal footing 
with other producers also aim to increase the participation of local citizens in renewable energy projects and 
theref ore increase acceptance of renewable energy . 
(71)  The specific character istics of local renewable energy communities in term s of size, ownership structure and the 
number of projects can hampe r their competition on an equal footing with large-scale players, namely 
competit ors with larger projects or portfolios. Theref ore, it should be possible for Member States to choose any 
form of entity for renewable energy communities, provid ed that such an entity may, acting in its own name, 
exer cise rights and be subject to oblig ations. To avoid abuse and to ensure broad participation, renewable energy 
communities should be capable of remaining auton omous from individual members and other traditional mark et 
actors that participat e in the community as members or shareholders, or who cooperat e through other means 
such as inve stment. Participation in renewable energy projects should be open to all poten tial local members 
based on objective, transparent and non-discr iminator y criteria. Measures to offset the disadvantag es relating to 
the specific character istics of local renewable energy communities in terms of size, ownership structure and the 
number of projects include enabling renewable energy communities to operat e in the energy system and easing 
their market integration. Renewable energy communities should be able to share between themselves energy that 
is produced by their community-owned installations. However , community members should not be exempt from 21.12.2018 L 328/92 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     relevant costs, charg es, levies and taxes that would be borne by final consumers who are not community 
members, producers in a similar situation, or where public grid infrastr ucture is used for those transfers. 
(72)  Household consumers and communities engaging in renewables self-consump tion should maintain their rights as 
consumers, including the rights to have a contract with a supplier of their choice and to switc h supplier . 
(73)  Representing around half of the final energy consum ption of the Union, the heating and cooling sector is 
considered to be a key sector in accelerating the decarbonisation of the energy system . Moreo ver, it is also 
a strategic sector in term s of energy secur ity, as around 40 % of the renewable energy consump tion by 2030 is 
projecte d to come from renewable heating and cooling. However , the absence of a harmonised strateg y at Union 
level, the lack of internal isation of external costs and the fragmentation of heating and cooling markets have, to 
date, led to relatively slow progress in the sector . 
(74)  Several Member State s have implemented measures in the heating and cooling sector to reac h their 2020 
renewable energy targe t. However , in the absence of binding national targets post-2020, the remaining national 
incentives may not be sufficient to reach the long-ter m decarbonisation goals for 2030 and 2050. In order to 
meet such goals, reinf orce investor certainty and foster the development of a Union-wide renewable heating and 
cooling mark et, while respecting the energy efficiency first principle, it is appropr iate to encourage the efforts of 
Member States in the supply of renewable heating and cooling to contr ibut e to the progressive increase of the 
share of renewable energy . Given the fragment ed nature of some heating and cooling mark ets, it is of utmost 
importance to ensure flexibility in designing such an effort. It is also important to ensure that a potential uptak e 
of renewable heating and cooling does not have detr imental environmental side-eff ects or lead to dispropor ­
tionate overall costs. In order to minimise that risk, the increase of the share of renewable energy in the heating 
and cooling sector should take into account the situation of those Member States where the share is already very 
high, or where waste heat and cold is not used, such as in Cypr us and Malta. 
(75)  Distr ict heating and cooling currently represents around 10 % of the heat demand across the Union, with large 
discrepancies between Member State s. The Commission's heating and cooling strateg y has recognised the 
poten tial for decarbonisation of distr ict heating through increased energy efficiency and renewable energy 
deplo yment. 
(76)  The Energy Union strategy also recognised the role of the citizen in the energy transition, where citizens take 
ownership of the energy transition, benefit from new technologies to reduce their bills, and participate actively in 
the mark et. 
(77)  The potential synergies between an effort to increase the uptak e of renewable heating and cooling and the 
existing schemes under Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (1) and 
Directive 2012/27/EU should be emph asised. Member States should, to the extent possible, have the possibility to 
use existing administrative structures to implement such effort, in order to mitigat e the administrative burden. 
(78)  In the area of distr ict heating, it is theref ore crucial to enable the fuel-switchin g to energy from renewable sources 
and prevent regulator y and technology lock -in and technology lock -out through reinf orced rights for renewable 
energy producers and final consumers, and bring the tools to final consumers to facilitate their choice between 
the highest energy-perf ormance solutions that take into account future heating and cooling needs in accordance 
with expected building performa nce criteria. Final consumers should be given transparent and reliable 
information on the efficiency of distr ict heating and cooling systems and the share of energy from renewable 
sources in their specific heating or cooling supply . 
(79)  In order to prot ect consumers of distr ict heating and cooling systems that are not efficient distr ict heating and 
cooling syste ms and to allow them to produce their heating or cooling from renewable sources and with signif i­
cantly bette r energy performa nce, consumers should be entitled to disconnect and thus discontinue the heating 
or cooling service from non-efficient distr ict heating and cooling system s at a whole building level by term inating 
their contract or, where the contract covers several buildings, by modifying the contract with the distr ict heating 
or cooling operat or. 21.12.2018 L 328/93 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     
(1)Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 2010 on the energy performance of buildings 
(OJ L 153, 18.6.2010, p. 13). (80)  To prepare for the transition towards advanced biofuels and minimise the overall direct and indirect land-use 
change impacts, it is appropr iate to limit the amount of biofuels and bioliquids produced from cereal and other 
starc h-rich crops, suga rs and oil crops that can be counte d towards the targe ts laid down in this Directive, 
without restr icting the overall possibility of using such biofuels and bioliquids. The establishment of a limit at 
Union level should not prevent Member State s from provi ding for lower limits to the amount of biofuels and 
bioliquids produced from cereal and other starch-r ich crops, sugars and oil crops that can be counte d at national 
level towards the targe ts laid down in this Directive, without restr icting the overall possibility of using such 
biofuels and bioliquids. 
(81)  Directive 2009/28/EC introduced a set of sustainability criteria, including criteria protectin g land with high 
biodiversity value and land with high-carbon stoc k, but did not cover the issue of indirect land-use change. 
Indirect land-use change occurs when the cultivation of crops for biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels displaces 
traditional production of crops for food and feed purposes. Such additional demand increases the pressure on 
land and can lead to the extension of agricultural land into areas with high-carbon stoc k, such as forests, 
wetlands and peatland, causing additional greenhouse gas emissions. Directive (EU) 2015/1513 of the European 
Parliament and of the Council (1) recognises that the magnitude of greenhouse gas emissions-link ed indirect land- 
use change is capable of negating some or all greenhouse gas emissions savings of individual biofuels, bioliquids 
or biomass fuels. While there are risks arising from indirect land-use change, research has shown that the scale of 
the effect depends on a variety of factors, including the type of feedstoc k used for fuel production, the level of 
additional demand for feedstoc k triggered by the use of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels, and the extent to 
whic h land with high-carbon stoc k is protect ed worldwide. 
While the level of greenhouse gas emissions caused by indirect land-use chang e cannot be unequivocally 
determined with the level of precision required to be included in the greenhouse gas emission calculation 
methodology , the highest risks of indirect land-use chang e have been identif ied for biofuels, bioliquids and 
biomass fuels produced from feedstoc k for which a significant expansion of the production area into land with 
high-carbon stoc k is obser ved. It is theref ore appropr iate, in general, to limit food and feed crops-based biofuels, 
bioliquids and biomass fuels promoted under this Directive and, in addition, to require Member States to set 
a specific and gradually decreasing limit for biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels produced from food and feed 
crops for which a significant expansion of the production area into land with high-carbon stoc k is obser ved. Low 
indirect land-use chang e-risk biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels should be exem pt from the specifi c and 
gradually decreasing limit. 
(82)  Yield increases in agricultural sectors by means of impro ved agricultural practices, inve stments in bette r 
machi nery and knowledg e transfer , beyond levels which would have prevailed in the absence of productivity- 
promoting schem es for food and feed crop-based biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels, as well as the cultivation 
of crops on land not previously used for the cultivation of crops, can mitig ate indirect land-use change. Where 
there is evidence that such measures have led to an increase of production going beyond the expect ed increase in 
productivity , biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels produced from such additional feedstoc k should be considered 
to be low indirect land-use change -risk biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels. Annual yield fluctuations should be 
take n into account in that context. 
(83)  Directive (EU) 2015/1513 called on the Commission to submit, without dela y, a compr ehensive proposal for 
a cost-eff ective and technology-neutral post-2020 policy in order to creat e a long-t erm perspective for investment 
in sustainable biofuels with a low risk of causing indirect land-use change with a headline target of decarbonising 
the transpor t sector. An obligation on Member States to require fuel suppliers to deliver an overall share of fuels 
from renewable sources can provide certainty for inve stors and encourag e the continuous development of 
alternative renewable transpor t fuels including advanced biofuels, renewable liquid and gaseous transpor t fuels of 
non-biological origin, and renewable electr icity in the transpor t sector . Since renewable alternati ves might not be 
available or cost-effi cient to all fuel suppliers, it is appropr iate to allow Member States to distinguish between fuel 21.12.2018 L 328/94 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     
(1)Directive (EU) 2015/1513 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 Sept ember 2015 amending Directive 98/70/EC relating to 
the quality of petrol and diesel fuels and amending Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources 
(OJ L 239, 15.9.2015, p. 1). suppliers and to exempt, if necessar y, particular types of fuel supplier from the oblig ation. As transpor t fuels are 
traded easily , fuel suppliers in Member States with low supplies of the relevant resources are likely easily to 
obtain renewable fuels from other sources. 
(84)  A Union database should be put in place to ensure transparency and traceability of renewable fuels. While 
Member State s should be allowed to continue to use or establish national databases, those national databases 
should be linked to the Union database, in order to ensure instant data transfers and harmonisation of data 
flows. 
(85)  Advanced biofuels and other biofuels and biogas produced from feedstoc k liste d in an annex to this Directive, 
renewable liquid and gaseous transpor t fuels of non-biological origin, and renewable electr icity in the transpor t 
sector can contr ibute to low carbon emissions, stimulating the decarbonisation of the Union transpor t sector in 
a cost-effective manner , and impro ving, inter alia, energy diversifi cation in the transpor t sector while promoting 
inno vation, growth and jobs in the Union economy and reducing reliance on energy imports. An oblig ation on 
Member States to require fuel suppliers to ensure a minimum share of advanced biofuels and certain biogases, is 
intende d to encourage continuous development of advanced fuels, including biofuels. It is important to ensure 
that that oblig ation also promotes impro vements in the greenhouse gas perf ormance of the fuels supplied to 
meet it. The Commission should assess the greenhouse gas performa nce, technical innovation and sustainability 
of those fuels. 
(86)  With regard to Intelli gent Transpor t, it is impor tant to increase the development and deplo yment of electr ic 
mobility for road, as well as to accelerat e the integrat ion of advanced technologies into innovati ve rail. 
(87)  Electromobility is expect ed to constitute a substantial part of the renewable energy in the transpor t sector by the 
year 2030. Further incentives should be provid ed consider ing the swif t development of electromobility and the 
poten tial of that sector in term s of growth and jobs in the Union. Multipliers for renewable electr icity supplied 
for the transpor t sector should be used for the promotion of renewable electr icity in the transpor t sector and in 
order to reduce the compar ative disadvantag e in energy statistics. Since it is not possible to account for all 
electr icity supplied for road vehicles in statistics through dedicat ed meter ing, such as charging at home, 
multipliers should be used in order to ensure that the positive impa cts of electr ified renewable energy-based 
transpor t are properly accounted for. Options should be explored to ensure that the new demand for electr icity 
in the transpor t sector is met with additional generation capacity of energy from renewable sources. 
(88) In light of climatic constraints that limit the possibility of consuming certain types of biofuels due to environmen ­
tal, technical or health concer ns, and due to the size and structure of their fuel mark ets, it is appropr iate that 
Cypr us and Malta, for the purposes of demonstrating compl iance with national renewable energy oblig ations 
placed on fuel suppliers, be allowed to take into account those inherent limitations. 
(89)  The promotion of recy cled carbon fuels can contr ibute towards the policy objectives of energy diversifi cation and 
decarbonisation of the transpor t sector where they fulfil the appropr iate minimum greenhouse gas emissions 
savings threshold. It is theref ore appropr iate to include those fuels in the obligation on fuel supplier , whilst giving 
Member States the option not to consider those fuels in the obligation if they do not wish to do so. Since those 
fuels are not renewable, they should not be counte d towards the overall Union target for energy from renewable 
sources. 
(90)  Renewable liquid and gaseous transpor t fuels of non-biological origin are impor tant to increase the share of 
renewable energy in sector s that are expected to rely on liquid fuels in the long term . To ensure that renewable 
fuels of non-biological origin contr ibute to greenhouse gas reduction, the electr icity used for the fuel production 
should be of renewable origin. The Commission should develop, by means of delega ted acts, a reliable Union 
methodology to be applied where such electr icity is take n from the grid. That methodology should ensure that 
there is a temporal and geographical correlation between the electr icity production unit with whic h the producer 
has a bilat eral renewables power purchase agreement and the fuel production. For exam ple, renewable fuels of 
non-biological origin cannot be counte d as fully renewable if they are produced when the contracted renewable 
generation unit is not generating electr icity . Another example is the case of electr icity grid cong estion, where 
fuels can be counted as fully renewable only when both the electr icity generation and the fuel production plants 21.12.2018 L 328/95 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     are locat ed on the same side in respect of the cong estion. Further more, there should be an element of addit ­
ionality , meaning that the fuel producer is adding to the renewable deplo yment or to the financing of renewable 
energy . 
(91)  Feedstoc k which has low indirect land-use change impacts when used for biofuels, should be promote d for its 
contr ibution to the decarbonisation of the econom y. Feedstoc k for advanced biofuels and biogas for transpor t, 
for which technology is more inno vative and less mature and theref ore needs a higher level of suppor t, should, in 
particular , be included in an annex to this Directive. In order to ensure that it is updat ed in accordance with the 
lates t technological developments while avoiding unint ended negativ e effects, the Commission should review that 
annex in order to assess whether new feedstoc k should be added. 
(92)  The costs of connecting new producers of gas from renewable sources to the gas grids should be based on 
objective, transparent and non-discr iminato ry criteria and due account should be taken of the benefit that 
embedded local producers of gas from renewable sources bring to the gas grids. 
(93)  In order to exploit the full potential of biomass, whic h does not include peat or mater ial embedded in geological 
formations and/or transf ormed to fossil, to contr ibut e to the decarbonisation of the econom y through its uses for 
mate rials and energy , the Union and the Member State s should promot e great er sustainable mobilisation of 
existing timber and agricultural resources and the development of new forestr y and agriculture production 
system s, provi ded that sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria are met. 
(94)  Biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels should alwa ys be produced in a sustainable manner . Biofuels, bioliquids 
and biomass fuels used for compl iance with the Union target laid down in this Directive, and those whic h benefi t 
from suppor t sche mes, should theref ore be required to fulfil sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving 
criteria. The harmonisation of those criteria for biofuels and bioliquids is essential for the achi evement of the 
energy policy objectives of the Union as set out in Article 194(1) TFEU. Such harmonisation ensures the 
functioning of the internal energy mark et and thus facilitates, especially with regard to the oblig ation of 
Member States not to refuse to take into account, on other sustainability grounds, biofuels and bioliquids 
obtained in accordance with this Directive, trade between Member State s in compl iant biofuels and bioliquids. The 
positive effects of the harmonisation of those criteria on the smooth functioning of the intern al energy mark et 
and on the avoidance of distor tion of compet ition in the Union cannot be frustrated. For biomass fuels, 
Member States should be allowed to establish additional sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving 
criteria. 
(95) The Union should take appropr iate steps in the conte xt of this Directive, including the promotion of sustain ­
ability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria for biofuels, and for bioliquids and biomass fuels. 
(96)  The production of agricultural raw mater ial for biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels, and the incentives provided 
for in this Directive to promote their use, should not have the effect of encouraging the destr uction of biodiverse 
lands. Such finite resources, recognised in various intern ational instr uments to be of universal value, should be 
preser ved. It is theref ore necessar y to provi de sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria ensur ing 
that biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels qualify for the incentives only where it is guaranteed that agricultural 
raw mater ial does not originate from biodiverse areas or, in the case of areas designate d for nature prot ection 
purposes or for the protect ion of rare, threatened or endangered ecosystem s or species, the relevant compet ent 
author ity demonstrates that the production of the agricultural raw mater ial does not interfere with such 
purposes. 
(97)  Forests should be considered to be biodiverse in accordance with the sustainability criteria where they are 
primar y forests in accordance with the definit ion used by the Food and Agriculture Org anisation of the United 
Nations (FAO) in its Global Forest Resource Assessment, or where they are protect ed by national nature 
prot ection law. Areas where the collection of non-wood forest products occurs should be considered to be 
biodiverse forests, provid ed that the human impa ct is small. Other types of forest as defined by the FAO, such as 
modified natural forests, semi-natural forests and plantations, should not be considered to be primar y 21.12.2018 L 328/96 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     forests. Having regard, further more, to the highly biodiverse nature of certain grasslands, both temperat e and 
tropical, including highly biodiverse savannahs, stepp es, scrublands and prair ies, biofuels, bioliquids and biomass 
fuels made from agricultural raw mater ials originating in such lands should not qualify for the incentives 
provid ed for by this Directive. In order to establish appropr iate criteria to define such highly biodiverse grassland 
in accordance with the best available scientific data and relevant international standards, imple menting powers 
should be conferr ed on the Commission. 
(98)  Land should not be conver ted to accommodat e the production of agricultural raw mater ial for biofuels, 
bioliquids and biomass fuels if its carbon stoc k loss upon conversion could not, within a reasonable period, 
taking into account the urgency of tack ling climate change, be compen sated for by the greenhouse gas emission 
savings resulting from the production and use of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels. This would prevent 
unnecessar y, burdensome research by economic operat ors and the convers ion of high-carbon-stoc k land that are 
demonstrate d to be ineligible for producing agricultural raw mate rials for biofuels bioliquids and biomass 
fuels. Inventories of worldwide carbon stoc ks indicate that wetlands and continuously forested areas with 
a canop y cover of more than 30 % should be included in that cate gory. 
(99)  In the framew ork of the Common Agricultural Policy , Union farmers should comply with a comprehensive set of 
environmental requirements in order to receive direct suppor t. Comp liance with those requirements can be most 
effectively verified in the context of agricultural policy . Including those requirements in the sustainability schem e 
is not appropr iate as the sustainability criteria for bioenergy should set out rules that are objective and apply 
globally . Verification of compliance under this Directive would also risk causing an unnecessar y administrative 
burden. 
(100)  Agricultural feedstoc k for the production of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels should be produced using 
practices that are consistent with the protection of soil quality and soil organic carbon. Soil quality and soil 
carbon should theref ore be included in monit oring system s of operat ors or national author ities. 
(101)  It is appropr iate to introduce Union-wide sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria for biomass 
fuels used in the electr icity sector and in the heating and cooling sector, in order to continue to ensure high 
greenhouse gas emissions savings compared to fossil fuel altern atives, to avoid unint ended sustainability impacts, 
and to promote the internal mark et. The outermost regions should be able to use the potential of their resources 
in order to increase the production of renewable energy and their energy independence. 
(102)  To ensure that, despit e the growing demand for forest biomass, harvesting is carried out in a sustainable manner 
in forests where regener ation is ensured, that special attention is given to areas explicitly designated for the 
prot ection of biodiversity , landscapes and specific natural elements, that biodiversity resources are preser ved and 
that carbon stoc ks are track ed, woody raw mate rial should emanate only from forests that are harveste d in 
accordance with the principles of sustainable forest manag ement that are developed under internati onal forest 
processes such as Forest Europe and that are imp lemented through national law or the best management 
practices at sourcing area level. Operato rs should take the appropr iate steps in order to minimise the risk of 
using unsustainable forest biomass for the production of bioenergy . To that end, operators should put in place 
a risk-based approac h. In this context, it is appropr iate for the Commission to develop operational guidance on 
the verification of compl iance with the risk-based approach by means of implementing acts, after consulting the 
Committ ee on the Sustainability of Biofuels, Bioliquids and Biomass fuels. 
(103)  Harvesting for energy purposes has increased and is expect ed to continue to grow, resulting in higher impor ts of 
raw mate rials from third countr ies as well as an increase of the production of those mater ials within the Union. 
It should be ensured that harvesting is sustainable. 
(104)  In order to minimise the administrative burden, the Union sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving 
criteria should apply only to electr icity and heating from biomass fuels produced in installations with a total 
rated ther mal input equal to or exceed ing 20 MW . 21.12.2018 L 328/97 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     (105)  Biomass fuels should be conver ted into electr icity and heat in an efficient way in order to maximise energy 
secur ity and greenhouse gas emissions savings, as well as to limit emissions of air pollutants and minimise the 
pressure on limited biomass resources. 
(106)  The minimum greenhouse gas emissions savings threshold for biofuels, bioliquids and biogas for transpor t 
produced in new installations should be increased in order to improve their overall greenhouse gas balance and 
to discourag e further investments in installations with a low greenhouse gas emission savings perf ormance. That 
increase provides inve stment safeg uards for biofuels, bioliquids and biogas for transpor t production capacity . 
(107)  Based on exper ience in the practical implementation of the Union sustainability criteria, it is appropr iate to 
strengthen the role of volun tary internati onal and national certificat ion schemes for verification of compl iance 
with the sustainability criteria in a harmonised manner . 
(108)  It is in the interests of the Union to encourag e the development of volun tary intern ational or national schem es 
that set standards for the production of sustainable biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels and that certify that the 
production of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels meets those standards. For that reason, provis ion should be 
made for sche mes to be recognised as provid ing reliable evidence and data where they meet adequate standards 
of reliability , transparency and independent auditing. In order to ensure that compliance with the sustainability 
and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria is verified in a robust and harmonised manner and in particular to 
prevent fraud, the Commission should be emp owered to adopt detailed implementing rules, including adequate 
standards of reliability , transparency and independent auditing to be applied by the voluntar y sche mes. 
(109)  Voluntar y sche mes play an increasing ly important role in provid ing evidence of compliance with the sustainability 
and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria for biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels. It is theref ore appropr iate 
for the Commission to require voluntar y schemes, including those already recognised by the Commission, to 
repor t regularly on their activity . Such repor ts should be made public in order to increase transparency and to 
improve super vision by the Commission. Further more, such repor ting would provide the necessar y information 
for the Commission to repor t on the operation of the volun tary sche mes with a view to identifying best practices 
and submitting, if appropr iate, a proposal to further promote such best practices. 
(110)  To facilitate the functioning of the internal mark et, evidence regar ding the sustainability and greenhouse gas 
emissions criteria for biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels that have been obtained in accordance with a sche me 
that has been recognised by the Commission should be accept ed in all Member States. Member States should 
contr ibute towards ensur ing the correct implementation of the certification principles of voluntar y schemes by 
super vising the operation of certificat ion bodies that are accredited by the national accreditation body and by 
informing the voluntar y schem es about relevant obser vations. 
(111)  In order to avoid a dispropor tionate administrative burden, a list of default values should be laid down for 
common biofuel, bioliquid and biomass fuel production pathwa ys and that list should be updated and expanded 
when further reliable data are available. Economic operat ors should alwa ys be entitled to claim the level of 
greenhouse gas emissions savings for biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels established by that list. Where the 
default value for greenhouse gas emissions savings from a production pathwa y lies below the required minimum 
level of greenhouse gas emissions savings, producers wishing to demonstrate their compliance with that 
minimum level should be required to show that the actual greenhouse gas emissions from their production 
process are lower than those that were assumed when calculating the default values. 
(112)  It is necessar y to lay down clear rules based on objective and non-discr iminato ry criteria, for the calculation of 
greenhouse gas emissions savings from biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels and their fossil fuel comparat ors. 
(113)  In accordance with current technical and scientific knowledg e, the greenhouse gas emissions accounting 
methodology should take into account the transf ormation of solid and gaseous biomass fuels into final energy in 
order to be consist ent with the calculation of renewable energy for the purposes of counting towards the Union 
target laid down in this Directive. The allocation of greenhouse gas emissions to co-products, as distinct from 
waste s and residues, should also be reviewed in cases where electr icity or heating and cooling are produced in co- 
generation or multi-ge neration plants. 21.12.2018 L 328/98 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     (114)  If land with high stoc ks of carbon in its soil or in its vegetation is conver ted for the cultivation of raw mate rials 
for biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels, some of the stored carbon will generally be released into the 
atmosphere, leading to the formation of carbon dioxide (CO2). The resulting negative greenhouse gas impa ct can 
offset the positive greenhouse gas impact of the biofuels, bioliquids or biomass fuels, in some cases by a wide 
margin. The full carbon effects of such conversion should theref ore be taken into account in calculating the 
greenhouse gas emissions savings of particular biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels. This is necessar y to ensure 
that the greenhouse gas emissions saving calculation takes into account the tota lity of the carbon effects of the 
use of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels. 
(115)  In calculating the greenhouse gas impact of land conver sion, economic operat ors should be able to use actual 
values for the carbon stoc ks associated with the reference land use and the land use after convers ion. They should 
also be able to use standard values. The methodology of the Intergo vernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
is the appropr iate basis for such standard values. That work is not currently expressed in a form that is 
immediate ly applicable by economic operat ors. The Commission should theref ore revise its guidelines of 10 June 
2010 for the calculation of land carbon stoc ks for the purposes of the rules for calculating the greenhouse gas 
impact of biofuels, bioliquids and their fossil fuel comparat ors, which are set out in an annex to this Directive, 
while ensur ing consistency with Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1). 
(116)  Co-products from the production and use of fuels should be taken into account in the calculation of greenhouse 
gas emissions. The substitution method is appropr iate for the purposes of policy analysis, but not for the 
regulation of individual economic operat ors and individual consignments of transpor t fuels. In those cases, the 
energy allocation method is the most appropr iate method, as it is easy to apply , is predictable over time, 
minimises counter -productive incentives and produces results that are general ly compar able with those produced 
by the substitution method. For the purposes of policy analysis, the Commission should also, in its repor ting, 
present results using the substitution method. 
(117)  Co-products are different from residues and agricultural residues, as they are the primar y aim of the production 
process. It is theref ore appropr iate to clarify that agricultural crop residues are residues and not co-products. This 
has no implications on the existing methodology but clarifies the existing provisions. 
(118)  The established method of using energy allocation as a rule for dividing greenhouse gas emissions between co- 
products has worked well and should be continued. It is appropr iate to align the methodology for calculating 
greenhouse gas emissions coming from the use of combined heat and power (CHP) when the CHP is used in 
processing biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels to the methodology applied to a CHP being the end-use. 
(119)  The methodology takes into account the reduced greenhouse gas emissions arising from the use of CHP , 
compar ed to the use of electr icity plants and heat-only plants, by taking into account the utility of heat compar ed 
to electr icity , and the utility of heat at differ ent temperatures. It follows that higher temperature should bear 
a larger part of the total greenhouse gas emissions than heat at low temperature, when the heat is co-produced 
with electr icity . The methodology take s into account the whole pathwa y to final energy , including conversion to 
heat or electr icity . 
(120) It is appropr iate for the data used in the calculation of the default values to be obtained from independent, scien ­
tifically exper t sources and to be updated as appropr iate as those sources progress their work. The Commission 
should encourage those sources to address, when they update their work, emissions from cultivation, the effects 
of regional and climat ological conditions, the effects of cultivation using sustainable agricultural and organic 
farming methods, and the scientifi c contr ibutions of producers in the Union and in third countr ies, and civil 
society . 21.12.2018 L 328/99 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     
(1)Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on a mec hanism for monitor ing and 
repor ting greenhouse gas emissions and for repor ting other information at national and Union level relevant to climate chang e and 
repealing Decision No 280/2004/EC (OJ L 165, 18.6.2013, p. 13). (121)  Global demand for agricultural commodities is growing. Part of that increase in demand is likely to be met 
through an increase in the amount of land devot ed to agriculture. The restoration of land that has been severely 
degraded and theref ore cannot other wise be used for agricultural purposes is a way of increasing the amount of 
land available for cultivation. The sustainability schem e should promote the use of such restored land because the 
promotion of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels will contr ibut e to the growth in demand for agricultural 
commodities. 
(122)  In order to ensure the harmonised implementation of the greenhouse gas emissions calculation methodology and 
to align to the latest scientifi c evidence, implementing powers should be conferr ed on the Commission to adapt 
the methodological principles and values necessar y for assessing whether greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria 
have been fulfilled and to assess whether repor ts submitte d by Member States and third countr ies contain 
accurat e data on cultivation emissions of feedstoc k. 
(123)  European gas grids are becoming more integrat ed. The promotion of the production and use of biomethane, its 
injection into a natural gas grid and cross-border trade create a need to ensure proper accounting of renewable 
energy as well as avoiding double incentives resulting from suppor t schemes in differ ent Member States. The 
mass balance system relat ed to verification of bioenergy sustainability and the new Union database are intended 
to help address those issues. 
(124)  The achi evement of the objectives of this Directive requires that the Union and Member States dedicat e 
a signif icant amount of financial resources to research and development in relation to renewable energy 
technologies. In particular , the European Institut e of Innovatio n and Techn ology should give high priority to the 
research and development of renewable energy technologies. 
(125)  The implementation of this Directive should, where relevant, reflect the Convention on Access to Information, 
Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Envi ronmental Matters, in particular as 
implemented through Directive 2003/4/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (1). 
(126)  In order to amend or supplement non-essential elements of this Directive, the power to adop t acts in accordance 
with Article 290 TFEU should be delegat ed to the Commission in respect of establishing the methodology for 
calculating the quantity of renewable energy used for cooling and distr ict cooling and amending the methodology 
for calculating energy from heat pumps; establishing the URDP and setting the conditions for finalising 
transactions of statistical transfer between Member States via the URDP; establishing appropr iate minimum

Article 3 
Binding overall Union target for 2030 
1. Member States shall collectively ensure that the share of energy from renewable sources in the Union's gross final 
consum ption of energy in 2030 is at least 32 %. The Commission shall assess that targe t with a view to submitting 
a legislative proposal by 2023 to increase it where there are further substantial costs reductions in the production of 
renewable energy , where needed to meet the Union's international commitments for decarbonisation, or where 
a significant decrease in energy consump tion in the Union justifies such an increase. 
2. Member State s shall set national contr ibutions to meet, collectively , the binding overall Union targe t set in 
paragraph 1 of this Article as part of their integrat ed national energy and climate plans in accordance with Articles 3 
to 5 and 9 to 14 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. In prepar ing their draf t integrat ed national energy and climate plans, 
Member States may consider the formula referred to in Annex II to that Regulation. 
If, on the basis of the assessment of the draf t integrat ed national energy and climat e plans submitted pursuant to 
Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, the Commission concludes that the national contr ibutions of the Member States 
are insuffic ient for the collective achieve ment of the binding overall Union targe t, it shall follow the procedure laid down 
in Articles 9 and 31 of that Regulation. 
3. Member States shall ensure that their national policies, including the oblig ations deriving from Articles 25 to 28 of 
this Directive, and their suppor t schemes, are designed with due regard to the waste hierarch y as set out in Article 4 of 
Directive 2008/98/EC to aim to avoid undue distor tive effects on the raw mater ial markets. Member State s shall grant 
no suppor t for renewable energy produced from the incineration of waste if the separate collection oblig ations laid 
down in that Directive have not been compl ied with. 
4. From 1 Januar y 2021, the share of energy from renewable sources in each Member State 's gross final consump tion 
of energy shall not be lower than the baseline share shown in the third column of the table in Part A of Annex I to this 
Directive. Member State s shall take the necessar y measures to ensure compl iance with that baseline share. If 
a Member State does not maintain its baseline share as measured over any one-year period, the first and second sub­
paragraphs of Article 32(4) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 shall apply . 
5. The Commission shall suppor t the high ambition of Member States through an enabling framewor k comprising 
the enhanced use of Union funds, including additional funds to facilitate a just transition of carbon intensive regions 
towards increased shares of renewable energy , in particular financial instr uments, especially for the followi ng purposes: 
(a)  reducing the cost of capital for renewable energy projects; 
(b)  developing projects and programmes for integrating renewable sources into the energy system, for increasing 
flexibility of the energy system , for maintaining grid stability and for managing grid congestions; 
(c) developing transmission and distr ibution grid infrastr ucture, intelligent netw orks, storag e facilities and intercon ­

6. The Commission shall establish a facilitative platf orm in order to suppor t Member State s that use cooperation 
mech anisms to contr ibute to the binding overall Union target set in paragraph 1. 
Article 4 
Suppor t schemes for energy from renewable sources 
1. In order to reac h or exceed the Union target set in Article 3(1), and each Member State's contr ibution to that 
target set at a national level for the deplo yment of renewable energy , Member State s may apply suppor t sche mes. 
2. Suppor t schem es for electr icity from renewable sources shall provid e incentives for the integrat ion of electr icity 
from renewable sources in the electr icity market in a market-based and market-res ponsive way, while avoiding 
unnecessar y distor tions of electr icity mark ets as well as taking into account possible system integration costs and grid 
stability . 
3. Suppor t sche mes for electr icity from renewable sources shall be designed so as to maximise the integration of 
electr icity from renewable sources in the electr icity market and to ensure that renewable energy producers are 
responding to market price signals and maximise their market revenues. 
To that end, with rega rd to direct price suppor t schemes, suppor t shall be grant ed in the form of a mark et premium, 
whic h could be, inter alia, sliding or fixed. 
Member States may exem pt small-scale installations and demonstration projects from this paragraph, without prejudice 
to the applicable Union law on the intern al market for electr icity . 
4. Member State s shall ensure that suppor t for electr icity from renewable sources is granted in an open, transparent, 
competiti ve, non-discr iminator y and cost-eff ective manner . 
Member States may exem pt small-scale installations and demonstration projects from tenderi ng procedures. 
Member States may also consider establishing mechanisms to ensure the regional diversifi cation in the deplo yment of 
renewable electr icity , in particular to ensure cost-effi cient system integration. 
5. Member State s may limit tender ing procedures to specifi c technologies where opening suppor t sche mes to all 
producers of electr icity from renewable sources would lead to a subopt imal result, in view of: 
(a)  the long-term poten tial of a particular technology ; 
(b)  the need to achieve diversification; 
(c)  grid integration costs; 
(d)  netw ork constraints and grid stability ; 
(e)  for biomass, the need to avoid distor tions of raw mate rials mark ets. 
6. Where suppor t for electr icity from renewable sources is grant ed by means of a tendering procedure, Member State s 
shall, in order to ensure a high project realisation rate: 
(a)  establish and publish non-discr iminato ry and transparent criteria to qualify for the tenderi ng procedure and set clear 
date s and rules for deliver y of the project ; 
(b)  publish information about previous tenderi ng procedures, including project realisation rates. 
7. In order to increase the generation of energy from renewable sources in the outermost regions and small islands, 
Member State s may adapt financial suppor t schemes for projects locat ed in those regions in order to take into account 
the production costs associated with their specifi c conditions of isolation and extern al dependence. 21.12.2018 L 328/106 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     8. By 31 December 2021 and ever y three years thereaf ter, the Commission shall repor t to the European Parliament 
and to the Council on the performa nce of suppor t for electr icity from renewable sources grant ed by means of tenderi ng 
procedures in the Union, analysing in particular the ability of tendering procedures to: 
(a)  achieve cost-reduction; 
(b)  achieve technological improvement; 
(c)  achieve high realisation rates; 
(d)  provid e non-discr iminato ry participation of small actor s and, where applicable, local author ities; 
(e)  limit environmental impact ; 
(f)  ensure local acceptability ; 
(g)  ensure secur ity of supply and grid integration. 
9. This Article shall apply without prejudice to Articles 107 and 108 TFEU. 
Article 5 
Opening of suppor t schemes for electr icity from renewable sources 
1. Member States shall have the right, in accordance with Articles 7 to 13 of this Directive, to decide to whic h exte nt 
they suppor t electr icity from renewable sources whic h is produced in another Member State. However , Member States 
may open participation in suppor t schemes for electr icity from renewable sources to producers located in other 
Member States, subject to the conditions laid down in this Article. 
When opening participation in suppor t schem es for electr icity from renewable sources, Member State s may provide that 
suppor t for an indicative share of the newly-suppor ted capacity , or of the budget allocat ed thereto, in each year is open 
to producers locat ed in other Member States. 
Such indicative shares may, in each year, amount to at least 5 % from 2023 to 2026 and at least 10 % from 2027 to 
2030, or, where lowe r, to the level of interconnectivity of the Member State concer ned in any given year. 
In order to acquire further implementation exper ience, Member States may organise one or more pilot schemes where 
suppor t is open to producers locat ed in other Member State s. 
2. Member States may require proof of physical impor t of electr icity from renewable sources. To that end, 
Member States may limit participation in their suppor t schem es to producers locat ed in Member State s with whic h there 
is a direct connection via inter connectors. However , Member States shall not change or other wise affect cross-zonal 
sched ules and capacity allocation due to producers participating in cross-border suppor t schem es. Cross-border 
electr icity transfe rs shall be determined only by the outcome of capacity allocation pursuant to Union law on the 
internal mark et in electr icity . 
3. If a Member State decides to open participation in suppor t schem es to producers locat ed in other Member States, 
the relevant Member States shall agree on the principles of such participation. Such agreements shall cover at least the 
principles of allocation of renewable electr icity that is the subject of cross-border suppor t. 
4. The Commission shall, upon the request of the relevant Member States, assist them throughout the negotiation 
process with the setting up of cooperation arrangements by providing information and analysis, including quantitative 
and qualitative data on the direct and indirect costs and benefits of cooperation, as well as with guidance and technical 
exper tise. The Commission may encourage or facilitate the exchange of best practices and may develop templates for 
cooperation agreements in order to facilitate the negotiation process. The Commission shall assess, by 2025, the costs 
and benefits of the deplo yment of electr icity from renewable sources in the Union pursuant to this Article. 
5. By 2023, the Commission shall carry out an evaluation of the implementation of this Article. That evaluation shall 
assess the need to introduce an obligation on Member States partially to open participation in their suppor t sche mes for 
electr icity from renewable sources to producers located in other Member States with a view to a 5 % opening by 2025 
and a 10 % opening by 2030. 21.12.2018 L 328/107 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     Article 6 
Stability of financial suppor t 
1. Without prejudice to adapta tions necessar y to compl y with Articles 107 and 108 TFEU, Member States shall 
ensure that the level of, and the conditions attach ed to, the suppor t grant ed to renewable energy projects are not revised 
in a way that negat ively affects the rights conferr ed thereunder and under mines the economic viability of projects that 
already benefit from suppor t. 
2. Member States may adjust the level of suppor t in accordance with objective criteria, provid ed that such criteria are 
established in the original design of the suppor t sche me. 
3. Member States shall publish a long-term sche dule anticipating the expect ed allocation of suppor t, covering, as 
a reference, at least the followi ng five years, or, in the case of budget ary planning constraints, the follo wing three years, 
including the indicative timing, the frequency of tendering procedures where appropr iate, the expected capacity and 
budget or maximum unitar y suppor t expect ed to be allocat ed, and the expected eligible technologies, if applicable. That 
sched ule shall be update d on an annual basis or, where necessar y, to reflect recent mark et developments or expect ed 
allocation of suppor t. 
4. Member States shall, at least ever y five years, assess the effectiveness of their suppor t schem es for electr icity from 
renewable sources and their major distr ibutive effects on differ ent consumer groups, and on investments. That 
assessment shall take into account the effect of possible changes to the suppor t schemes. The indicative long-t erm 
planning governing the decisions of the suppor t and design of new suppor t shall take into account the results of that 
assessment. Member States shall include the assessment in the relevant updat es of their integrat ed national energy and 
climat e plans and progress repor ts in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. 
Article 7 
Calculation of the share of energy from renewable sources 
1. The gross final consum ption of energy from renewable sources in each Member State shall be calculated as the 
sum of: 
(a)  gross final consump tion of electr icity from renewable sources; 
(b)  gross final consump tion of energy from renewable sources in the heating and cooling sector; and 
(c)  final consum ption of energy from renewable sources in the transpor t sector . 
With regar d to point (a), (b), or (c) of the first subparagraph, gas, electr icity and hydrog en from renewable sources shall 
be considered only once for the purposes of calculating the share of gross final consump tion of energy from renewable 
sources. 
Subject to the second subparagraph of Article 29(1), biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels that do not fulfil the sustain ­
ability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria laid down in Article 29(2) to (7) and (10) shall not be taken into 
account. 
2. For the purposes of point (a) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, gross final consump tion of electr icity from 
renewable sources shall be calculat ed as the quantity of electr icity produced in a Member State from renewable sources, 
including the production of electr icity from renewables self-consumers and renewable energy communities and 
excl uding the production of electr icity in pumped storag e units from water that has previously been pumped uphill. 
In multi-fuel plants using renewable and non-renewable sources, only the part of electr icity produced from renewable 
sources shall be taken into account. For the purposes of that calculation, the contr ibution of each energy source shall be 
calculat ed on the basis of its energy conte nt. 
The electr icity generat ed by hydropo wer and wind power shall be accounte d for in accordance with the normalisation 
rules set out in Annex II. 21.12.2018 L 328/108 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     3. For the purposes of point (b) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, gross final consum ption of energy from 
renewable sources in the heating and cooling sector shall be calculated as the quantity of distr ict heating and cooling 
produced in a Member State from renewable sources, plus the consump tion of other energy from renewable sources in 
industr y, households, services, agriculture, forestr y and fisher ies, for heating, cooling and processing purposes. 
In multi-fuel plants using renewable and non-renewable sources, only the part of heating and cooling produced from 
renewable sources shall be taken into account. For the purposes of that calculation, the contr ibution of each energy 
source shall be calculat ed on the basis of its energy content. 
Ambient and geotherma l energy used for heating and cooling by means of heat pumps and distr ict cooling systems shall 
be taken into account for the purposes of point (b) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, provid ed that the final 
energy output signif icantly exceed s the primar y energy input required to drive the heat pumps. The quantity of heat or 
cold to be considered to be energy from renewable sources for the purposes of this Directive shall be calculat ed in 
accordance with the methodology set out in Annex VII and shall take into account energy use in all end-use sectors . 
Ther mal energy generated by passive energy syste ms, under which lower energy consump tion is achi eved passively 
through building design or from heat generat ed by energy from non-renewable sources, shall not be take n into account 
for the purposes of point (b) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1. 
By 31 December 2021, the Commission shall adopt delegat ed acts in accordance with Article 35 to supplement this 
Directive by establishing a methodology for calculating the quantity of renewable energy used for cooling and distr ict 
cooling and to amend Annex VII. 
That methodology shall include minimum seasonal performa nce factors for heat pumps operating in reverse mode. 
4. For the purposes of point (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, the followi ng requirements shall apply: 
(a)  Final consum ption of energy from renewable sources in the transpor t sector shall be calculated as the sum of all 
biofuels, biomass fuels and renewable liquid and gaseous transpor t fuels of non-biological origin consumed in the 
transpor t sector . However , renewable liquid and gaseous transpor t fuels of non-biological origin that are produced 
from renewable electr icity shall be considered to be part of the calculation pursuant to point (a) of the first 
subparagraph of paragraph 1 only when calculating the quantity of electr icity produced in a Member State from 
renewable sources. 
(b)  For the calculation of final consump tion of energy in the transpor t sector , the values regarding the energy cont ent of 
transpor t fuels, as set out in Annex III, shall be used. For the determination of the energy content of transpor t fuels 
not included in Annex III, Member States shall use the relevant European Standards Organisation (ESO) standards in 
order to determine the calor ific values of fuels. Where no ESO standard has been adopt ed for that purpose, 
Member States shall use the relevant Internati onal Org anization for Standardisation (ISO) standards. 
5. The share of energy from renewable sources shall be calculat ed as the gross final consump tion of energy from 
renewable sources divided by the gross final consump tion of energy from all energy sources, expressed as a percentag e. 
For the purposes of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, the sum refer red to in the first subparagraph of 
paragraph 1 of this Article shall be adjusted in accordance with Articles 8, 10, 12 and 13. 
In calculating a Member State 's gross final consum ption of energy for the purposes of measur ing its compl iance with 
the targe ts and indicative traject ory laid down in this Directive, the amount of energy consumed in aviation shall, as 
a propor tion of that Member State's gross final consump tion of energy , be considered to be no more than 6,18 %. For 
Cypr us and Malta the amount of energy consumed in aviation shall, as a propor tion of those Member States' gross final 
consum ption of energy , be considered to be no more than 4,12 %. 
6. The methodology and definitions used in the calculation of the share of energy from renewable sources shall be 
those provid ed for in Regulation (EC) No 1099/2008. 
Member States shall ensure coherence of the statistical information used in calculating those sectoral and overall shares 
and of the statistical information repor ted to the Commission pursuant to that Regulation. 21.12.2018 L 328/109 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     Article 8

energy share of the Member State making the transfer for the purposes of this Directive; and 
(b)  added to the amount of energy from renewable sources that is taken into account in calculating the renewable 
energy share of the Member State accepti ng the transfer for the purposes of this Directive. 
2. In order to facilitat e the achievement of the Union target set in Article 3(1) of this Directive and of each 
Member State 's contr ibution to that target in accordance with Article 3(2) of this Directive, and to facilitat e statistical 
transfer s in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article, the Commission shall establish a Union renewable development 
platf orm (‘URDP’). Member States may, on a voluntar y basis, submit to the URDP annual data on their national contr i­
butions to the Union targe t or any benc hmark set for monitori ng progress in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, including the 
amount by which they expect to fall shor t of or exceed their contr ibution, and an indication of the price at which they 
would accept to transfe r any excess production of energy from renewable sources from or to another Member State. The 
price of those transfer s shall be set on a case-by-case basis based on the URDP demand-and-supply match ing 
mech anism. 
3. The Commission shall ensure that the URDP is able to match the demand for and supply of the amounts of energy 
from renewable sources that are taken into account in the calculation of the renewable energy share of a Member State 
based on prices or other criteria specifi ed by the Member State accepti ng the transfer . 
The Commission is empo wered to adopt delegat ed acts in accordance with Article 35 to supplement this Directive by 
establishing the URDP and setting the conditions for the finalisation of transfe rs as referred to in paragraph 5 of this 
Article. 
4. The arrangements refer red to in paragraphs 1 and 2 may have a duration of one or more calendar years. Such 
arrang ements shall be notified to the Commission or finalised on the URDP not later than 12 months after the end of 
each year in whic h they have effect. The information sent to the Commission shall include the quantity and price of the 
energy involved. For transfers finalised on the URDP , the parties involved and the information on the particular transfer 
shall be disclosed to the public. 
5. Transf ers shall become effective after all Member States involved in the transfer have notified the transfe r to the 
Commission or after all clear ing conditions are met on the URDP , as applicable.

operational at the moment at which the increase of capacity occur red. 
Article 15 
Administ rativ e procedures, regulations and codes 
1. Member States shall ensure that any national rules concer ning the author isation, certification and licensing 
procedures that are applied to plants and associated transmission and distr ibution netw orks for the production of 
electr icity , heating or cooling from renewable sources, to the process of transf ormation of biomass into biofuels, 
bioliquids, biomass fuels or other energy products, and to renewable liquid and gaseous transpor t fuels of non-biological 
origin are propor tionate and necessar y and contr ibut e to the implementation of the energy efficiency first principle. 
Member States shall, in particular , take the appropr iate steps to ensure that: 
(a)  administrative procedures are streamlined and expedited at the appropr iate administrative level and predictable 
timeframes are established for the procedures refer red to in the first subparagraph; 
(b)  rules concer ning author isation, certificat ion and licensing are objective, transparent and propor tionate, do not 
discr iminate between applicants and take fully into account the particular ities of individual renewable energy 
technologies; 
(c)  administrative charges paid by consumers, planners, archit ects, builders and equipment and system installers and 
suppliers are transparent and cost-relat ed; and 
(d)  simplified and less burdensome author isation procedures, including a simple-notifi cation procedure, are established 
for decentralised devices, and for producing and stori ng energy from renewable sources. 
2. Member States shall clearly define any technical specif ications which are to be met by renewable energy equipment 
and systems in order to benefi t from suppor t schemes. Where European standards exist, including eco-labels, energy 
labels and other technical reference system s established by the European standardisation bodies, such technical specifi ­
cations shall be expressed in term s of those standards. Such technical specifi cations shall not prescr ibe where the 
equipment and system s are to be certified and shall not impede the proper functioning of the internal market. 
3. Member States shall ensure that their compet ent author ities at national, regional and local level include provisions 
for the integration and deplo yment of renewable energy , including for renewables self-consump tion and renewable 
energy communities, and the use of unav oidable waste heat and cold when planning, including early spatial planning, 
designing, building and renovating urban infrastr ucture, industr ial, commercial or residential areas and energy 
infrastr ucture, including electr icity , distr ict heating and cooling, natural gas and altern ative fuel netw orks. Member States 
shall, in particular , encourage local and regional administrative bodies to include heating and cooling from renewable 
sources in the planning of city infrastr ucture where appropr iate, and to consult the network operators to reflect the 
impact of energy efficiency and demand response programs as well as specific provisions on renewables self- 
consum ption and renewable energy communities, on the infrastr ucture development plans of the operat ors. 
4. Member States shall introduce appropr iate measures in their building regulations and codes in order to increase 
the share of all kinds of energy from renewable sources in the building sector . 
In establishing such measures or in their suppor t schemes, Member State s may take into account, where applicable, 
national measures relating to substantial increases in renewables self-consump tion, in local energy storag e and in energy 
efficiency , relating to cogeneration and relating to passive, low-e nergy or zero-energy buildings. 21.12.2018 L 328/114 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     Member State s shall, in their building regulations and codes or by other means with equivalent effect, require the use of 
minimum levels of energy from renewable sources in new buildings and in existing buildings that are subject to major 
renov ation in so far as technically , functionally and economically feasible, and reflecting the results of the cost-optimal 
calculation carried out pursuant to Article 5(2) of Directive 2010/31/EU, and in so far as this does not negatively affect 
indoor air quality . Member States shall permit those minimum levels to be fulfilled, inter alia, through efficient distr ict 
heating and cooling using a significant share of renewable energy and waste heat and cold. 
The requirements laid down in the first subparagraph shall apply to the armed forces only to the extent that its 
application does not cause any conf lict with the nature and primar y aim of the activities of the armed forces and with 
the excep tion of mate rial used excl usively for militar y purposes. 
5. Member State s shall ensure that new public buildings, and existing public buildings that are subject to major 
renov ation, at national, regional and local level, fulfil an exem plar y role in the context of this Directive from 1 Januar y 
2012. Member States may, inter alia, allow that oblig ation to be fulfilled by compl ying with nearly zero-energy building 
provis ions as required in Directive 2010/31/EU, or by providing for the roofs of public or mixed private-public 
buildings to be used by third parties for installations that produce energy from renewable sources. 
6. With respect to their building regulations and codes, Member States shall promote the use of renewable heating 
and cooling syste ms and equipment that achi eve a significant reduction of energy consump tion. To that end, 
Member States shall use energy or eco-labels or other appropr iate certificates or standards developed at national or 
Union level, where these exist, and ensure the provision of adequat e information and advice on renewable, highly energy 
efficient alternatives as well as eventual financia l instr uments and incentives available in the case of replacement, with 
a view to promoting an increased replacement rate of old heating systems and an increased switch to solutions based on 
renewable energy in accordance with Directive 2010/31/EU. 
7. Member State s shall carry out an assessment of their potential of energy from renewable sources and of the use of 
waste heat and cold in the heating and cooling sector . That assessment shall, where appropr iate, include spatial analysis 
of areas suitable for low-ecological-r isk deplo yment and the poten tial for small-scale household projects and shall be 
included in the second compre hensive assessment required pursuant to Article 14(1) of Directive 2012/27/EU for the 
first time by 31 December 2020 and in the subsequent updates of the compreh ensive assessments. 
8. Member State s shall assess the regulator y and administrative barriers to long-t erm renewables power purcha se 
agreements, and shall remove unjustified barriers to, and facilitate the uptak e of, such agreements. Member State s shall 
ensure that those agreements are not subject to dispropor tionate or discr iminato ry procedures or charg es. 
Member State s shall descr ibe policies and measures facilita ting the uptak e of renewables power purch ase agreements in 
their integrated national energy and climate plans and progress repor ts pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. 
Article 16 
Organisation and duration of the permit-g ranting process 
1. Member State s shall set up or designat e one or more contact points. Those contact points shall, upon request by 
the applicant, guide through and facilitate the entire administrative permit application and granting process. The 
applicant shall not be required to contact more than one contact point for the entire process. The permit-granting 
process shall cover the relevant administrative permits to build, repo wer and operat e plants for the production of energy 
from renewable sources and assets necessar y for their connection to the grid. The permit-granting process shall 
comprise all procedures from the ackno wledgment of the receipt of the application to the transmission of the outcome 
of the procedure refer red to in paragraph 2. 
2. The contact point shall guide the applicant through the administrative permit application process in a transparent 
manner up to the deliver y of one or several decisions by the responsible author ities at the end of the process, provid e 
the applicant with all necessar y information and involve, where appropr iate, other administrative author ities. Applicants 
shall be allowed to submit relevant documents also in digital form. 21.12.2018 L 328/115 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     3. The contact point shall make available a manual of procedures for developers of renewable energy production 
projects and shall provide that information also online, addressing distinctly also small-scale projects and renewables 
self-consumers projects. The online information shall indicate the contact point relevant to the applicant's application. If 
a Member State has more than one contact point, the online information shall indicate the contact point relevant to the 
applicant's application. 
4. Without prejudice to paragraph 7, the permit-granting process referred to in paragraph 1 shall not excee d two 
years for power plants, including all relevant procedures of compet ent author ities. Where duly justified on the grounds 
of extraordinar y circumstances, that two- year period may be exte nded by up to one year. 
5. Without prejudice to paragraph 7, the permit-granting process shall not excee d one year for installations with an 
electr ical capacity of less than 150 kW. Where duly justif ied on the grounds of extraordinar y circumstances, that one- 
year period may be extended by up to one year. 
Member States shall ensure that applicants have easy access to simple procedures for the settlement of disputes 
concer ning the permit-granting process and the issuance of permits to build and operat e renewable energy plants, 
including, where applicable, alternative dispute resolution mecha nisms. 
6. Member States shall facilitate the repo wering of existing renewable energy plants by ensur ing a simplified and swif t 
permit-granting process. The length of that process shall not exceed one year. 
Where duly justified on the grounds of extraordinar y circumstances, such as on grounds of overriding safety reasons 
where the repower ing project impacts substantially on the grid or the original capacity , size or perf ormance of the 
installation, that one-year period may be extended by up to one year. 
7. The deadlines established in this Article shall apply without prejudice to obligations under applicable Union en­
vironmental law, to judicial appeals, remedies and other proceedings before a cour t or tribunal, and to altern ative 
dispute resolution mec hanisms, including compl aints procedures, non-judicial appeals and remedies, and may be 
extende d for the duration of such procedures. 
8. Member State s may establish a simple-notification procedure for grid connections for repo wering projects as 
referred to in Article 17(1). Where Member State s do so, repower ing shall be permitted followi ng notifi cation to the 
relevant author ity where no significant negative envi ronmental or social impa ct is expect ed. That author ity shall decide 
within six months of receip t of a notifi cation whether this is suffic ient. 
Where the relevant author ity decides that a notifi cation is sufficient, it shall automatical ly grant the permit. Where that 
author ity decides that the notifi cation is not suffi cient, it shall be necessar y to apply for a new permit and the time- 
limits refer red to in paragraph 6 shall apply . 
Article 17 
Simple-notif ication procedure for grid connections 
1. Member States shall establish a simple-notific ation procedure for grid connections whereby installations or 
aggregat ed production units of renewables self-consumers and demonstration projects, with an electr ical capacity of 
10,8 kW or less, or equivalent for connections other than three-phase connections, are to be connected to the grid 
follo wing a notifi cation to the distr ibution system operat or. 
The distr ibution system operator may, within a limited period followi ng the notifi cation, reject the request ed grid 
connection or propose an alternative grid connection point on justified grounds of safety concer ns or technical 
incompati bility of the syste m compo nents. In the case of a positive decision by the distr ibution system operat or, or in 
the absence of a decision by the distr ibution system operat or within one month followi ng the notifi cation, the 
installation or aggreg ated production unit may be connected . 
2. Member States may allow a simple-notification procedure for installations or aggreg ated production units with an 
electr ical capacity of abov e 10,8 kW and up to 50 kW, provi ded that grid stability , grid reliability and grid safety are 
maintained. 21.12.2018 L 328/116 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     Article 18

the criteria laid down in Annex IV. Each Member State shall recognise the certification awarded by other Member States 
in accordance with those criteria. 
4. Member States shall mak e information on certificat ion sche mes or equivalent qualification schemes as refer red to 
in paragraph 3 available to the public. Member States may also make the list of installers who are qualified or certified 
in accordance with paragraph 3 available to the public. 
5. Member States shall ensure that guidance is made available to all relevant actors, in particular to planners and 
arch itects so that they are able properly to consider the optimal combination of energy from renewable sources, of high- 
efficiency technologies, and of distr ict heating and cooling when planning, designing, building and renov ating industr ial, 
commercial or residential areas. 
6. Member States, where appropr iate with the participation of local and regional author ities, shall develop suitable 
information, awar eness-raising, guidance or training programmes in order to inform citizens of how to exer cise their 
rights as active customer s, and of the benefits and practicalities, including technical and financial aspects, of developing 
and using energy from renewable sources, including by renewables self-consum ption or in the framewor k of renewable 
energy communities. 
Article 19 
Guarantees of origin for energy from renewable sources 
1. For the purposes of demonstrating to final custom ers the share or quantity of energy from renewable sources in 
an energy supplier's energy mix and in the energy supplied to consumers under contracts mark eted with reference to the 
consum ption of energy from renewable sources, Member States shall ensure that the origin of energy from renewable 
sources can be guarant eed as such within the meaning of this Directive, in accordance with objective, transparent and 
non-discr iminato ry criteria. 
2. To that end, Member State s shall ensure that a guarant ee of origin is issued in response to a request from 
a producer of energy from renewable sources, unless Member States decide, for the purposes of accounting for the 
mark et value of the guarantee of origin, not to issue such a guarant ee of origin to a producer that receives financial 
suppor t from a suppor t scheme. Member States may arrang e for guarant ees of origin to be issued for energy from non- 
renewable sources. Issuance of guarantees of origin may be made subject to a minimum capacity limit. A guarant ee of 
origin shall be of the standard size of 1 MWh. No more than one guarantee of origin shall be issued in respect of each 
unit of energy produced. 
Member States shall ensure that the same unit of energy from renewable sources is taken into account only once. 
Member States shall ensure that when a producer receives financial suppor t from a suppor t scheme, the market value of 
the guarant ee of origin for the same production is take n into account appropr iately in the relevant suppor t scheme. 21.12.2018 L 328/117 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     It shall be presumed that the market value of the guarant ee of origin has been take n into account appropr iately in any 
of the following cases: 
(a)  where the financia l suppor t is grant ed by way of a tendering procedure or a tradable green certificate system; 
(b)  where the mark et value of the guarant ees of origin is administratively take n into account in the level of financial 
suppor t; or 
(c)  where the guarant ees of origin are not issued directly to the producer but to a supplier or consumer who buys the 
energy from renewable sources either in a compe titive setting or in a long-ter m renewables power purchase 
agreement. 
In order to take into account the market value of the guarant ee of origin, Member States may, inter alia, decide to issue 
a guarant ee of origin to the producer and immediately cancel it. 
The guarant ee of origin shall have no function in term s of a Member State's compl iance with Article 3. Transf ers of 
guarant ees of origin, separately or together with the physical transfer of energy , shall have no effect on the decision of 
Member States to use statistical transfer s, joint projects or joint suppor t sche mes for compl iance with Article 3 or on 
the calculation of the gross final consump tion of energy from renewable sources in accordance with Article 7. 
3. For the purposes of paragraph 1, guarantees of origin shall be valid for 12 months after the production of the 
relevant energy unit. Member States shall ensure that all guarant ees of origin that have not been cancelled expire at the 
latest 18 months after the production of the energy unit. Member States shall include expired guarant ees of origin in the 
calculation of their residual energy mix. 
4. For the purposes of disclosure refer red to in paragraphs 8 and 13, Member State s shall ensure that energy 
compan ies cancel guarantees of origin at the latest six months after the end of the validity of the guarant ee of origin. 
5. Member States or designat ed compet ent bodies shall super vise the issuance, transfer and cancellation of guarantees 
of origin. The designat ed compet ent bodies shall not have overlapping geographical responsibilities, and shall be 
independent of production, trade and supply activities. 
6. Member States or the designate d compet ent bodies shall put in place appropr iate mechani sms to ensure that 
guarant ees of origin are issued, transferr ed and cancelled electronically and are accurat e, reliable and fraud-resistant. 
Member States and designat ed compet ent bodies shall ensure that the requirements they impose compl y with the 
standard CEN - EN 16325. 
7. A guarant ee of origin shall specify at least: 
(a)  the energy source from which the energy was produced and the start and end date s of production; 
(b)  whether it relat es to: 
(i)  electr icity ; 
(ii)  gas, including hydrogen; or 
(iii)  heating or cooling; 
(c)  the identity , location, type and capacity of the installation where the energy was produced; 
(d)  whether the installation has benefi ted from investment suppor t and whether the unit of energy has benefited in any 
other way from a national suppor t scheme, and the type of suppor t schem e; 
(e)  the date on whic h the installation became operational; and 
(f)  the date and countr y of issue and a unique identif ication number . 
Sim plified information may be specifi ed on guarantees of origin from installations of less than 50 kW. 21.12.2018 L 328/118 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     8. Where an electr icity supplier is required to demonstrate the share or quantity of energy from renewable sources in 
its energy mix for the purposes of point (a) of Article 3(9) of Directive 2009/72/EC, it shall do so by using guarantees of 
origin excep t: 
(a)  as regards the share of its energy mix corresponding to non-track ed commercial offers, if any, for which the supplier 
may use the residual mix; or 
(b)  where a Member State decides not to issue guarantees of origin to a producer that receives financial suppor t from 
a suppor t scheme. 
Where Member States have arrang ed to have guarant ees of origin for other types of energy , suppliers shall use for 
disclosure the same type of guarant ees of origin as the energy supplied. Likewise, guarantees of origin creat ed pursuant 
to Article 14(10) of Directive 2012/27/EU may be used to substantiate any requirement to demonstrate the quantity of 
electr icity produced from high-eff iciency cogener ation. For the purposes of paragraph 2 of this Article, where electr icity 
is generat ed from high-eff iciency cogenera tion using renewable sources, only one guarantee of origin specifying both 
characteri stics may be issued. 
9. Member States shall recognise guarantees of origin issued by other Member States in accordance with this Directive 
excl usively as evidence of the elements refer red to in paragraph 1 and points (a) to (f) of the first subparagraph of 
paragraph 7. A Member State may refuse to recognise a guarant ee of origin only where it has well-f ounded doubts 
about its accuracy , reliability or veracity . The Member State shall notify the Commission of such a refusal and its justifi ­
cation. 
10. If the Commission find s that a refusal to recognise a guarant ee of origin is unfounded, the Commission may 
adopt a decision requir ing the Member State in question to recognise it. 
11. Member States shall not recognise guarant ees of origins issued by a third countr y excep t where the Union has 
concluded an agreement with that third countr y on mutual recognition of guarantees of origin issued in the Union and 
compati ble guarant ees of origin systems established in that third countr y, and only where there is direct import or 
expor t of energy . 
12. A Member State may, in accordance with Union law, introduce objective, transparent and non-discr iminato ry 
criteria for the use of guarant ees of origin in accordance with the oblig ations laid down in Article 3(9) of Directive 
2009/72/EC. 
13. The Commission shall adop t a repor t assessing options to establish a Union-wide green label with a view to 
promoting the use of renewable energy coming from new installations. Suppliers shall use the information contained in 
guarant ees of origin to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of such a label. 
Article 20 
Access to and operation of the grids 
1. Where relevant, Member States shall assess the need to extend existing gas network infrastr ucture to facilitate the 
integrat ion of gas from renewable sources. 
2. Where relevant, Member States shall require transmission system operat ors and distr ibution system operators in 
their territory to publish technical rules in accordance with Article 8 of Directive 2009/73/EC, in particular regarding 
netw ork connection rules that include gas quality , gas odoration and gas pressure requirements. Member States shall also 
require transmission and distr ibution syste m operat ors to publish the connection tariffs to connect gas from renewable 
sources based on objective, transparent and non-discr iminato ry criteria. 
3. Subject to their assessment included in the integrat ed national energy and climate plans in accordance with 
Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the necessity to build new infrastr ucture for distr ict heating and cooling from 
renewable sources in order to achieve the Union targe t set in Article 3(1) of this Directive, Member States shall, where 
relevant, take the necessar y steps with a view to developing a distr ict heating and cooling infrastr ucture to accommodat e 
the development of heating and cooling from large biomass, solar energy , ambient energy and geother mal energy 
facilities and from wast e heat and cold. 21.12.2018 L 328/119 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     Article 21

peer trading arrang ements, without being subject: 
(i)  in relation to the electr icity that they consume from or feed into the grid, to discr iminato ry or dispropor tionate 
procedures and charges, and to netw ork charges that are not cost-ref lective; 
(ii) in relation to their self-g enerated electr icity from renewable sources remaining within their premises, to discr imi­
nator y or dispropor tionat e procedures, and to any charges or fees; 
(b)  to install and operat e electr icity storag e systems combined with installations generating renewable electr icity for self- 
consump tion without liability for any double charge, including netw ork charges, for store d electr icity remaining 
within their premises; 
(c)  to maintain their rights and oblig ations as final consumers; 
(d)  to receive remuneration, including, where applicable, through suppor t sche mes, for the self-generat ed renewable 
electr icity that they feed into the grid, which reflects the mark et value of that electr icity and which may take into 
account its long-term value to the grid, the environment and society . 
3. Member States may apply non-discr iminato ry and propor tionate charges and fees to renewables self-consumers, in 
relation to their self-generat ed renewable electr icity remaining within their premises in one or more of the followi ng 
cases: 
(a)  if the self-g enerated renewable electr icity is effectively suppor ted via suppor t schemes, only to the extent that the 
economic viability of the project and the incentive effect of such suppor t are not under mined; 
(b)  from 1 December 2026, if the overall share of self-consum ption installations excee ds 8 % of the total installed 
electr icity capacity of a Member State, and if it is demonstrated, by means of a cost-benefit analysis performed by 
the national regulatory author ity of that Member State , whic h is conduct ed by way of an open, transparent and 
participatory process, that the provision laid down in point (a)(ii) of paragraph 2 either results in a signif icant dispro ­
portionate burden on the long-ter m financia l sustainability of the electr ic system, or creat es an incentive exceed ing 
what is objectively needed to achi eve cost-effective deplo yment of renewable energy , and that such burden or 
incentive cannot be minimised by taking other reasonable actions; or 
(c)  if the self-genera ted renewable electr icity is produced in installations with a tota l installed electr ical capacity of more 
than 30 kW. 
4. Member States shall ensure that renewables self-consumers locat ed in the same building, including multi-apar tment 
bloc ks, are entitled to enga ge jointly in activities refer red to in paragraph 2 and that they are permitted to arrang e 
shar ing of renewable energy that is produced on their site or sites between themselves, without prejudice to the netw ork 
charges and other relevant charg es, fees, levies and taxes applicable to each renewables self-consumer . Member States 
may differ entiate between individual renewables self-consumers and jointly acting renewables self-consumers. Any such 
differ entiation shall be propor tionate and duly justified. 
5. The renewables self-consumer's installation may be owned by a third party or manag ed by a third party for 
installation, operation, including metering and mainte nance, provid ed that the third party remains subject to the 
renewables self-consumer's instr uctions. The third party itself shall not be considered to be a renewables self-consumer . 21.12.2018 L 328/120 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     6. Member States shall put in place an enabling framework to promote and facilita te the development of renewables 
self-consump tion based on an assessment of the existing unjustified barriers to, and of the poten tial of, renewables self- 
consum ption in their territori es and energy netw orks. That enabling framew ork shall, inter alia: 
(a)  address accessibility of renewables self-consump tion to all final custome rs, including those in low-income or 
vulnerable households; 
(b)  address unjustified barriers to the financing of projects in the mark et and measures to facilitate access to finance; 
(c)  address other unjustifi ed regulatory barriers to renewables self-consum ption, including for tenants; 
(d)  address incentives to building owners to create oppor tunities for renewables self-consump tion, including for tenants;

Article 23 
Mains treaming renewable energy in heating and cooling 
1. In order to promot e the use of renewable energy in the heating and cooling sector, each Member State shall 
endeav our to increase the share of renewable energy in that sector by an indicative 1,3 percentage points as an annual 
average calculat ed for the periods 2021 to 2025 and 2026 to 2030, starting from the share of renewable energy in the 
heating and cooling sector in 2020, expressed in terms of national share of final energy consum ption and calculated in 
accordance with the methodology set out in Article 7, without prejudice to paragraph 2 of this Article. That increase 
shall be limite d to an indicative 1,1 percentage points for Member State s where waste heat and cold is not used. 
Member States shall, where appropr iate, prioritise the best available technologies. 
2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, when calculating its share of renewable energy in the heating and cooling sector 
and its average annual increase in accordance with that paragraph, each Member State: 
(a)  may count waste heat and cold, subject to a limit of 40 % of the average annual increase; 
(b)  where its share of renewable energy in the heating and cooling sector is above 60 %, may count any such share as 
fulfilling the average annual increase; and 
(c)  where its share of renewable energy in the heating and cooling sector is abov e 50 % and up to 60 %, may count any 
such share as fulfilling half of the averag e annual increase. 
When deciding which measures to adopt for the purposes of deplo ying energy from renewable sources in the heating 
and cooling sector , Member State s may take into account cost-eff ectiveness reflecting structural barriers arising from the 
high share of natural gas or cooling, or from a dispersed settlement structure with low population density . 21.12.2018 L 328/122 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     Where those measures would result in a lower average annual increase than that refer red to in paragraph 1 of this 
Article, Member States shall make it public, for instance by the means of their integrated national energy and climat e 
progress repor ts pursuant to Article 20 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, and provide the Commission with reasons, 
including of choice of measures as refer red to the second subparagraph of this paragraph. 
3. On the basis of objective and non-discr iminato ry criteria, Member States may establish and make public a list of 
measures and may designate and make public the implementing entities, such as fuel suppliers, public or professional 
bodies, which are to contr ibut e to the average annual increase refer red to in paragraph 1. 
4. Member States may implement the average annual increase referred to in paragraph 1 by means, inter alia, of one 
or more of the following options: 
(a)  physical incor poration of renewable energy or wast e heat and cold in the energy and energy fuel supplied for 
heating and cooling; 
(b)  direct mitig ation measures such as the installation of highly efficient renewable heating and cooling systems in 
buildings, or the use of renewable energy or wast e heat and cold in industr ial heating and cooling processes; 
(c)  indirect mitig ation measures covered by tradable certificates proving compl iance with the obligation laid down in 
paragraph 1 through suppor t to indirect mitigation measures, carried out by another economic operator such as an 
independent renewable technology installer or energy service compan y providing renewable installation services; 
(d)  other policy measures, with an equivalent effect, to reach the average annual increase refer red to in paragraph 1, 
including fiscal measures or other financial incentives. 
When adoptin g and implementing the measures refer red to in the first subparagraph, Member State s shall aim to ensure 
the accessibility of measures to all consumers, in particular those in low-income or vulnerable households, who would 
not other wise possess suffi cient up-front capital to benefi t. 
5. Member State s may use the structures established under the national energy savings obligations set out in Article 7 
of Directive 2012/27/EU to implement and monitor the measures refer red to in paragraph 3 of this Article. 
6. Where entities are designat ed under paragraph 3, Member States shall ensure that the contr ibution by those 
designat ed entities is measurable and verifiable and that the designat ed entities repor t annually on: 
(a)  the total amount of energy supplied for heating and cooling; 
(b)  the total amount of renewable energy supplied for heating and cooling; 
(c)  the amount of waste heat and cold supplied for heating and cooling; 
(d)  the share of renewable energy and waste heat and cold in the total amount of energy supplied for heating and 
cooling; and 
(e)  the type of renewable energy source. 
Article 24 
Dist rict heating and cooling 
1. Member States shall ensure that information on the energy perf ormance and the share of renewable energy in their 
distr ict heating and cooling system s is provid ed to final consumers in an easily accessible manner , such as on the 
suppliers' website s, on annual bills or upon request. 
2. Member States shall lay down the necessar y measures and conditions to allow customers of distr ict heating or 
cooling syste ms which are not efficient distr ict heating and cooling systems, or whic h are not such a system by 
31 December 2025 on the basis of a plan appro ved by the compe tent author ity, to disconnect by term inating or 
modifying their contract in order to produce heating or cooling from renewable sources themselves. 21.12.2018 L 328/123 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     Where the term ination of a contract is linked to physical disconnection, such a termination may be made conditional on 
compen sation for the costs directly incur red as a result of the physical disconnection and for the undepreciated portion 
of assets needed to provi de heat and cold to that customer . 
3. Member States may restr ict the right to disconnect by term inating or modifying a contract in accordance with 
paragraph 2 to custome rs who can demonstrate that the planned alternative supply solution for heating or cooling 
results in a signif icantly better energy performa nce. The energy-perf ormance assessment of the altern ative supply 
solution may be based on the energy perf ormance certificate. 
4. Member State s shall lay down the necessar y measures to ensure that distr ict heating and cooling syste ms 
contr ibute to the increase referred to in Article 23(1) of this Directive by implementing at least one of the two followi ng 
options: 
(a)  Endeav our to increase the share of energy from renewable sources and from waste heat and cold in distr ict heating 
and cooling by at least one percentage point as an annual average calculat ed for the period 2021 to 2025 and for 
the period 2026 to 2030, starting from the share of energy from renewable sources and from waste heat and cold 
in distr ict heating and cooling in 2020, expressed in term s of share of final energy consump tion in distr ict heating 
and cooling, by implementing measures that can be expecte d to trigger that averag e annual increase in years with 
normal climatic conditions. 
Member State s with a share of energy from renewable sources and from waste heat and cold in distr ict heating and 
cooling above 60 % may count any such share as fulfilling the averag e annual increase referred to in the first sub­
paragraph of this point. 
Member States shall lay down the necessar y measures to implement the average annual increase refer red to in the 
first subparagraph of this point in their integrat ed national energy and climate plans pursuant to Annex I to 
Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. 
(b)  Ensure that operat ors of distr ict heating or cooling systems are oblig ed to connect suppliers of energy from 
renewable sources and from waste heat and cold or are oblig ed to offer to connect and purcha se heat or cold from 
renewable sources and from waste heat and cold from third-par ty suppliers based on non-discr iminato ry criteria set 
by the compet ent author ity of the Member State concer ned, where they need to do one or more of the followi ng: 
(i)  meet demand from new customers; 
(ii)  replace existing heat or cold generation capacity ; 
(iii)  expand existing heat or cold generation capacity . 
5. Where a Member State exercises the option referred to in point (b) of paragraph 4, an operat or of a distr ict heating 
or cooling system may refuse to connect and to purch ase heat or cold from a third-par ty supplier where: 
(a)  the system lacks the necessar y capacity due to other supplies of waste heat and cold, of heat or cold from renewable 
sources or of heat or cold produced by high-eff iciency cogeneration; 
(b)  the heat or cold from the third-par ty supplier does not meet the technical paramete rs necessar y to connect and 
ensure the reliable and safe operation of the distr ict heating and cooling system; or 
(c)  the operat or can demonstrate that providing access would lead to an excessive heat or cold cost increase for final 
customer s compared to the cost of using the main local heat or cold supply with whic h the renewable source or 
waste heat and cold would compet e. 
Member States shall ensure that, when an operat or of a distr ict heating or cooling syste m refuses to connect a supplier 
of heating or cooling pursuant to the first subparagraph, information on the reasons for the refusal, as well as the 
conditions to be met and measures to be taken in the system in order to enable the connection, is provided by that 
operat or to the compet ent author ity in accordance with paragraph 9. 
6. Where a Member State exercises the option refer red to in point (b) of paragraph 4, it may exem pt operat ors of the 
follo wing distr ict heating and cooling systems from the application of that point : 
(a)  efficient distr ict heating and cooling; 
(b)  efficient distr ict heating and cooling that exploits high-eff iciency coge neration; 21.12.2018 L 328/124 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     (c)  distr ict heating and cooling that, on the basis of a plan appro ved by the compet ent author ity, is efficient distr ict 
heating and cooling by 31 December 2025; 
(d)  distr ict heating and cooling with a total rated ther mal input below 20 MW . 
7. The right to disconnect by terminating or modifying a contract in accordance with paragraph 2 may be exer cised 
by individual customers, by joint under takings formed by custom ers or by parties acting on behalf of customers. For 
multi-apar tment bloc ks, such disconnection may be exercised only at a whole building level in accordance with the 
applicable housing law. 
8. Member State s shall require electr icity distr ibution system operat ors to assess at least ever y four years, in 
cooperation with the operators of distr ict heating or cooling systems in their respective area, the potential for distr ict 
heating or cooling systems to provide balancing and other syste m services, including demand response and stori ng of 
excess electr icity from renewable sources, and whether the use of the identified potential would be more resource- and 
cost-efficient than altern ative solutions. 
9. Member States shall ensure that the rights of consumers and the rules for operating distr ict heating and cooling 
system s in accordance with this Article are clearly defined and enforced by the compet ent author ity. 
10. A Member State shall not be required to apply paragraphs 2 to 9 of this Article where: 
(a)  its share of distr ict heating and cooling is less than or equal to 2 % of the overall consump tion of energy in heating 
and cooling on 24 December 2018; 
(b)  its share of distr ict heating and cooling is increased abov e 2 % by developing new efficient distr ict heating and 
cooling based on its integrat ed national energy and climate plan pursuant to Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 
or the assessment refer red to in Article 15(7) of this Directive; or 
(c)  its share of syste ms refer red to in paragraph 6 of this Article constitutes over 90 % of total sales of its distr ict 
heating and cooling. 
Article 25 
Mains treaming renewable energy in the transpor t sector 
1. In order to mainstream the use of renewable energy in the transpor t sector, each Member State shall set an 
oblig ation on fuel suppliers to ensure that the share of renewable energy within the final consump tion of energy in the 
transpor t sector is at least 14 % by 2030 (minimum share) in accordance with an indicative trajecto ry set by the 
Member State and calculat ed in accordance with the methodology set out in this Article and in Articles 26 and 27. The 
Commission shall assess that obligation, with a view to submitting, by 2023, a legislative proposal to increase it in the 
event of further substantial costs reductions in the production of renewable energy , where necessar y to meet the Union's 
international commitments for decarbonisation, or where justified on the grounds of a signif icant decrease in energy 
consum ption in the Union. 
Member States may exem pt, or distinguish between, different fuel suppliers and different energy carriers when setting 
the oblig ation on the fuel suppliers, ensur ing that the varying degrees of matur ity and the cost of differ ent technologies 
are take n into account. 
For the calculation of the minimum share referred to in the first subparagraph, Member States: 
(a)  shall take into account renewable liquid and gaseous transpor t fuels of non-biological origin also when they are used 
as intermediate products for the production of convention al fuels; and 
(b)  may take into account recy cled carbon fuels. 
Within the minimum share referred to in the first subparagraph, the contr ibution of advanced biofuels and biogas 
produced from the feedst ock listed in Part A of Annex IX as a share of final consump tion of energy in the transpor t 
sector shall be at least 0,2 % in 2022, at least 1 % in 2025 and at least 3,5 % in 2030. 21.12.2018 L 328/125 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     Member States may exem pt fuel suppliers supplying fuel in the form of electr icity or renewable liquid and gaseous 
transpor t fuels of non-biological origin from the requirement to compl y with the minimum share of advanced biofuels 
and biogas produced from the feedst ock liste d in Part A of Annex IX with respect to those fuels. 
When setting the oblig ation refer red to in the first and fourth subparagraphs to ensure the achi evement of the share set 
out therein, Member States may do so, inter alia, by means of measures targeting volumes , energy content or greenhouse 
gas emissions, provided that it is demonstrated that the minimum shares refer red to in the first and fourth sub­
paragraphs are achieved. 
2. The greenhouse gas emissions savings from the use of renewable liquid and gaseous transpor t fuels of non- 
biological origin shall be at least 70 % from 1 Januar y 2021. 
By 1 Januar y 2021, the Commission shall adopt a delegat ed act in accordance with Article 35 to supplement this 
Directive by establishing appropr iate minimum thresholds for greenhouse gas emissions savings of recy cled carbon fuels 
through a life-cy cle assessment that takes into account the specificities of each fuel. 
Article 26 
Specif ic rules for biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels produced from food and feed crops 
1. For the calculation of a Member State's gross final consump tion of energy from renewable sources refer red to in 
Article 7 and the minimum share refer red to in the first subparagraph of Article 25(1), the share of biofuels and 
bioliquids, as well as of biomass fuels consumed in transpor t, where produced from food and feed crops, shall be no 
more than one percentage point higher than the share of such fuels in the final consump tion of energy in the road and 
rail transpor t sectors in 2020 in that Member State, with a maximum of 7 % of final consump tion of energy in the road 
and rail transpor t sectors in that Member State . 
Where that share is below 1 % in a Member State, it may be increased to a maximum of 2 % of the final consump tion 
of energy in the road and rail transpor t sector s. 
Member States may set a lower limit and may distinguish, for the purposes of Article 29(1), between diffe rent biofuels, 
bioliquids and biomass fuels produced from food and feed crops, taking into account best available evidence on indirect 
land-use change impact. Member States may, for example, set a lowe r limit for the share of biofuels, bioliquids and 
biomass fuels produced from oil crops. 
Where the share of biofuels and bioliquids, as well as of biomass fuels consumed in transpor t, produced from food and 
feed crops in a Member State is limited to a share lower than 7 % or a Member State decides to limit the share further , 
that Member State may reduce the minimum share refer red to in the first subparagraph of Article 25(1) according ly, by 
a maximum of 7 percentage points. 
2. For the calculation of a Member State's gross final consump tion of energy from renewable sources refer red to in 
Article 7 and the minimum share refer red to in the first subparagraph of Article 25(1), the share of high indirect land- 
use change-ri sk biofuels, bioliquids or biomass fuels produced from food and feed crops for which a signif icant 
expansion of the production area into land with high-carbon stock is obser ved shall not excee d the level of 
consum ption of such fuels in that Member State in 2019, unless they are certified to be low indirect land-use change- 
risk biofuels, bioliquids or biomass fuels pursuant to this paragraph. 
From 31 December 2023 until 31 December 2030 at the latest, that limit shall gradually decrease to 0 %. 
By 1 Febr uary 2019, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a repor t on the status 
of worldwide production expansion of the relevant food and feed crops. 21.12.2018 L 328/126 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     By 1 Febr uary 2019, the Commission shall adopt a delegat ed act in accordance with Article 35 to supplement this 
Directive by setting out the criteria for certification of low indirect land-use chang e-risk biofuels, bioliquids and biomass 
fuels and for deter mining the high indirect land-use change-risk feedstoc k for which a signif icant expansion of the 
production area into land with high-carbon stoc k is obser ved. The repor t and the accompan ying delega ted act shall be 
based on the best available scientific data. 
By 1 Sept ember 2023, the Commission shall review the criteria laid down in the delegat ed act refer red to in the fourth 
subparagraph based on the best available scientifi c data and shall adopt delegat ed acts in accordance with Article 35 to 
amend such criteria, where appropr iate, and to include a trajector y to gradually decrease the contr ibution to the Union 
target set in Article 3(1) and to the minimum share refer red to in the first subparagraph of Article 25(1), of high 
indirect land-use change -risk biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels produced from feedst ock for which a signif icant 
expansion of the production into land with high-carbon stoc k is obser ved. 
Article 27 
Calculation rules with regard to the minimum shares of renewable energy in the transpor t secto r 
1. For the calculation of the minimum shares refer red to in the first and fourth subparagraphs of Article 25(1), the 
follo wing provisions shall apply: 
(a)  for the calculation of the denominator , that is the energy content of road- and rail- transpor t fuels supplied for 
consump tion or use on the mark et, petrol, diesel, natural gas, biofuels, biogas, renewable liquid and gaseous 
transpor t fuels of non-biological origin, recy cled carbon fuels and electr icity supplied to the road and rail transpor t 
sector s, shall be take n into account ; 
(b)  for the calculation of the numerat or, that is the amount of energy from renewable sources consumed in the 
transpor t sector for the purposes of the first subparagraph of Article 25(1), the energy cont ent of all types of energy 
from renewable sources supplied to all transpor t sectors, including renewable electr icity supplied to the road and rail 
transpor t sectors , shall be take n into account. Member State s may also take into account recy cled carbon fuels. 
For the calculation of the numerator , the share of biofuels and biogas produced from the feedst ock liste d in Part B of 
Annex IX shall, excep t for in Cypr us and Malta, be limited to 1,7 % of the energy cont ent of transpor t fuels supplied 
for consump tion or use on the mark et. Member States may, where justif ied, modify that limit, taking into account 
the availabi lity of feedstoc k. Any such modification shall be subject to approval by the Commission; 
(c)  for the calculation of both numerator and denominat or, the values regarding the energy cont ent of transpor t fuels 
set out in Annex III shall be used. For the determination of the energy content of transpor t fuels not included in 
Annex III, the Member State s shall use the relevant ESO standards for the determination of the calor ific values of 
fuels. Where no ESO standard has been adopt ed for that purpose, the relevant ISO standards shall be used. The 
Commission is empo wered to adopt delegat ed acts in accordance with Article 35 to amend this Directive by 
adapt ing the energy content of transpor t fuels, as set out in Annex III, in accordance with scientific and technical 
progress. 
2. For the purposes of demonstrating compl iance with the minimum shares referred to in Article 25(1): 
(a)  the share of biofuels and biogas for transpor t produced from the feedstoc k liste d in Annex IX may be considered to 
be twice its energy conte nt; 
(b)  the share of renewable electr icity shall be considered to be four times its energy content when supplied to road 
vehicles and may be considered to be 1,5 times its energy cont ent when supplied to rail transpor t; 
(c)  with the excep tion of fuels produced from food and feed crops, the share of fuels supplied in the aviatio n and 
mar itime sector s shall be considered to be 1,2 times their energy cont ent. 
3. For the calculation of the share of renewable electr icity in the electr icity supplied to road and rail vehicles for the 
purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article, Member States shall refer to the two- year period before the year in whic h the 
electr icity is supplied in their territory . 21.12.2018 L 328/127 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     By way of derog ation from the first subparagraph of this paragraph, to deter mine the share of electr icity for the 
purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article, in the case of electr icity obtained from a direct connection to an installation 
generating renewable electr icity and supplied to road vehicles, that electr icity shall be fully count ed as renewable. 
In order to ensure that the expect ed increase in demand for electr icity in the transpor t sector beyond the current 
baseline is met with additional renewable energy generation capacity , the Commission shall develop a framewor k on ad­
ditionality in the transpor t sector and shall develop differ ent options with a view to determining the baseline of 
Member States and measur ing additionality . 
For the purposes of this paragraph, where electr icity is used for the production of renewable liquid and gaseous 
transpor t fuels of non-biological origin, either directly or for the production of interm ediat e products, the average share 
of electr icity from renewable sources in the countr y of production, as measured two years before the year in question, 
shall be used to determine the share of renewable energy . 
Howe ver, electr icity obtained from direct connection to an installation generating renewable electr icity may be fully 
counte d as renewable electr icity where it is used for the production of renewable liquid and gaseous transpor t fuels of 
non-biological origin, provid ed that the installation: 
(a)  comes into operation after, or at the same time as, the installation producing the renewable liquid and gaseous 
transpor t fuels of non-biological origin; and 
(b)  is not connected to the grid or is connected to the grid but evidence can be provided that the electr icity concer ned 
has been supplied without taking electr icity from the grid. 
Electr icity that has been taken from the grid may be count ed as fully renewable provi ded that it is produced excl usively 
from renewable sources and the renewable proper ties and other appropr iate criteria have been demonstrated, ensur ing 
that the renewable proper ties of that electr icity are claimed only once and only in one end-use sector . 
By 31 December 2021, the Commission shall adopt a delegat ed act in accordance with Article 35 to supplement this 
Directive by establishing a Union methodology setting out detailed rules by which economic operators are to compl y 
with the requirements laid down in the fifth and sixth subparagraphs of this paragraph. 
Article 28 
Other provisions on renewable energy in the transpor t sector 
1. With a view to minimising the risk of sing le consignments being claimed more than once in the Union, 
Member States and the Commission shall strengthen cooperation among national systems and between national syste ms 
and voluntar y sche mes and verifiers established pursuant to Article 30, including, where appropr iate, the exchange of 
data. Where the compet ent author ity of one Member State suspects or detects a fraud, it shall, where appropr iate, 
inform the other Member States. 
2. The Commission shall ensure that a Union database is put in place to enable the tracing of liquid and gaseous 
transpor t fuels that are eligible for being counte d towards the numerat or refer red to in point (b) of Article 27(1) or that 
are taken into account for the purposes refer red to in points (a), (b), and (c) of the first subparagraph of Article 29(1). 
Member States shall require the relevant economic operat ors to enter into that database information on the transactions 
made and the sustainability charact eristics of those fuels, including their life-cy cle greenhouse gas emissions, starting 
from their point of production to the fuel supplier that places the fuel on the market. A Member State may set up 
a national database that is linked to the Union database ensur ing that information entered is instantly transferr ed 
between the databases. 
Fuel suppliers shall enter the information necessar y to verify compl iance with the requirements laid down in the first 
and fourth subparagraphs of Article 25(1) into the relevant database. 
3. By 31 December 2021, Member States shall take measures to ensure the availability of fuels from renewable 
sources for transpor t including with rega rd to publicly accessible high-power recharging points and other refuelling 
infrastr ucture as provid ed for in their national policy framew orks in accordance with Directive 2014/94/EU. 21.12.2018 L 328/128 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     4. Member States shall have access to the Union database refer red to in paragraph 2 of this Article. They shall take 
measures to ensure that economic operators enter accurate information into the relevant database. The Commission 
shall require the schemes that are the subject of a decision pursuant to Article 30(4) of this Directive to verify 
compl iance with that requirement when chec king compl iance with the sustainability criteria for biofuels, bioliquids and 
biomass fuels. It shall publish, ever y two years, aggregat ed information from the Union database pursuant to Annex VIII 
to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. 
5. By 31 December 2021, the Commission shall adopt delegat ed acts in accordance with Article 35 to supplement 
this Directive by specifying the methodology to determine the share of biofuel, and biogas for transpor t, resulting from 
biomass being processed with fossil fuels in a common process, and by specifying the methodology for assessing 
greenhouse gas emissions savings from renewable liquid and gaseous transpor t fuels of non-biological origin and from 
recy cled carbon fuels, which shall ensure that credit for avoided emissions is not given for CO2 the captur e of whic h has 
already received an emission credit under other provisions of law. 
6. By 25 June 2019 and ever y two years thereaf ter, the Commission shall review the list of feedstoc k set out in 
Parts A and B of Annex IX with a view to adding feedstoc k in accordance with the principles set out in the third 
subparagraph. 
The Commission is empo wered to adop t deleg ated acts in accordance with Article 35 to amend the list of feedst ock set 
out in Parts A and B of Annex IX by adding, but not removi ng, feedstoc k. Feedstoc k that can be processed only with 
advanced technologies shall be added to Part A of Annex IX. Feedstoc k that can be processed into biofuels, or biogas for 
transpor t, with mature technologies shall be added to Part B of Annex IX. 
Such delegat ed acts shall be based on an analysis of the poten tial of the raw mate rial as feedstoc k for the production of 
biofuels and biogas for transpor t, taking into account all of the followi ng: 
(a)  the principles of the circular econom y and of the waste hierarch y established in Directive 2008/98/EC; 
(b)  the Union sustainability criteria laid down in Article 29(2) to (7); 
(c)  the need to avoid signif icant distor tive effects on mark ets for (by-)products, wastes or residues; 
(d)  the poten tial for deliver ing substantial greenhouse gas emissions savings compare d to fossil fuels based on a life- 
cycle assessment of emissions; 
(e)  the need to avoid negative impa cts on the environment and biodiversity ; 
(f)  the need to avoid creating an additional demand for land. 
7. By 31 December 2025, in the context of the biennial assessment of progress made pursuant to Regulation (EU) 
2018/1999, the Commission shall assess whether the oblig ation relating to advanced biofuels and biogas produced from 
feedstoc k listed in Part A of Annex IX laid down in the fourth subparagraph of Article 25(1) effectively stimulates 
innovati on and ensures greenhouse gas emissions savings in the transpor t sector . The Commission shall analyse in that 
assessment whether the application of this Article effectively avoids double accounting of renewable energy . 
The Commission shall, if appropr iate, submit a proposal to amend the oblig ation relating to advanced biofuels and 
biogas produced from feedstoc k liste d in Part A of Annex IX laid down in the fourth subparagraph of Article 25(1). 
Article 29 
Sust ainability and greenhouse gas emissions savin g criter ia for biofuels, bioliquids and biomass 
fuels 
1. Energy from biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels shall be take n into account for the purposes refer red to in 
points (a), (b) and (c) of this subparagraph only if they fulfil the sustainability and the greenhouse gas emissions saving

8. By 31 Januar y 2021, the Commission shall adopt implementing acts establishing the operational guidance on the 
evidence for demonstrating compliance with the criteria laid down in paragraphs 6 and 7 of this Article. Those 
implementing acts shall be adopt ed in accordance with the examination procedure refer red to in Article 34(3). 
9. By 31 December 2026, the Commission shall assess whether the criteria laid down in paragraphs 6 and 7 
effectively minimise the risk of using forest biomass derived from unsustainable production and address LULUCF 
criteria, on the basis of the available data. 
The Commission shall, if appropr iate, submit a legislative proposal to amend the criteria laid down in paragraphs 6 
and 7 for the period after 2030. 
10. The greenhouse gas emission savings from the use of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels take n into account 
for the purposes referred to in paragraph 1 shall be: 
(a)  at least 50 % for biofuels, biogas consumed in the transpor t sector , and bioliquids produced in installations in 
operation on or before 5 October 2015;

operation from 1 Januar y 2021 until 31 December 2025, and 80 % for installations starting operation from 
1 Januar y 2026. 
An installation shall be considered to be in operation once the physical production of biofuels, biogas consumed in the 
transpor t sector and bioliquids, and the physical production of heating and cooling and electr icity from biomass fuels 
has started. 
The greenhouse gas emission savings from the use of biofuels, biogas consumed in the transpor t sector , bioliquids and 
biomass fuels used in installations producing heating, cooling and electr icity shall be calculated in accordance with 
Article 31(1). 21.12.2018 L 328/132 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     11. Electr icity from biomass fuels shall be taken into account for the purposes referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of 
the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 only if it meets one or more of the follo wing requirements: 
(a)  it is produced in installations with a total rated ther mal input below 50 MW ; 
(b)  for installations with a total rated ther mal input from 50 to 100 MW , it is produced applying high-effici ency 
cogener ation technology , or, for electr icity-only installations, meeting an energy efficiency level associated with the 
best available techniques (BAT-AEELs) as defined in Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2017/1442 (1); 
(c)  for installations with a total rated ther mal input abov e 100 MW , it is produced applying high-efficiency cogeneration 
technology , or, for electr icity-only installations, achieving an net-electr ical efficiency of at least 36 %; 
(d)  it is produced applying Biomass CO2 Capt ure and Storag e. 
For the purposes of points (a), (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this Article, electr icity-only-instal ­
lations shall be take n into account only if they do not use fossil fuels as a main fuel and only if there is no cost-eff ective 
poten tial for the application of high-efficiency coge neration technology according to the assessment in accordance with 
Article 14 of Directive 2012/27/EU. 
For the purposes of points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this Article, this paragraph shall apply 
only to installations starting operation or conver ted to the use of biomass fuels after 25 December 2021. For the 
purposes of point (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this Article, this paragraph shall be without prejudice 
to suppor t granted under suppor t schemes in accordance with Article 4 approved by 25 December 2021. 
Member States may apply higher energy efficiency requirements than those referred in the first subparagraph to instal ­
lations with lower rated ther mal input. 
The first subparagraph shall not apply to electr icity from installations whic h are the object of a specifi c notification by 
a Member State to the Commission based on the duly substantiated existen ce of risks for the secur ity of supply of 
electr icity . Upon assessment of the notificati on, the Commission shall adopt a decision taking into account the elements 
included therein. 
12. For the purposes refer red to in points (a), (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this Article, and 
without prejudice to Articles 25 and 26, Member States shall not refuse to take into account, on other sustainability 
grounds, biofuels and bioliquids obtained in compl iance with this Article. This paragraph shall be without prejudice to 
public suppor t grant ed under suppor t sche mes approved before 24 December 2018. 
13. For the purposes referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this Article, Member States 
may derogat e, for a limited period of time, from the criteria laid down in paragraphs 2 to 7 and 10 and 11 of this 
Article by adopting differ ent criteria for: 
(a)  installations located in an outermost region as refer red to in Article 349 TFEU to the extent that such facilities 
produce electr icity or heating or cooling from biomass fuels; and 
(b)  biomass fuels used in the installations refer red to in point (a) of this subparagraph, irrespective of the place of origin 
of that biomass, provided that such criteria are objectively justified on the grounds that their aim is to ensure, for 
that outermost region, a smooth phase-in of the criteria laid down in paragraphs 2 to 7 and 10 and 11 of this 
Article and thereby incentivise the transition from fossil fuels to sustainable biomass fuels. 
The differ ent criteria refer red to in this paragraph shall be subject to a specifi c notificati on by the relevant Member State 
to the Commission. 
14. For the purposes referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, Member States 
may establish additional sustainability criteria for biomass fuels. 
By 31 December 2026, the Commission shall assess the impa ct of such additional criteria on the internal mark et, 
accompan ied, if necessar y, by a proposal to ensure harmonisation thereof. 21.12.2018 L 328/133 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

Verification of compliance with the sust ainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criter ia 
1. Where biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels, or other fuels that are eligible for counting towards the numerat or 
referred to in point (b) of Article 27(1), are to be take n into account for the purposes refer red to in Articles 23 and 25 
and in points (a), (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph of Article 29(1), Member States shall require economic operat ors 
to show that the sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria laid down in Article 29(2) to (7) and (10) 
have been fulfilled. For those purposes, they shall require economic operat ors to use a mass balance system whic h: 
(a)  allows consignments of raw mater ial or fuels with differin g sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving 
character istics to be mixed for instance in a container , processing or logistical facility , transmission and distr ibution 
infrastr ucture or site; 
(b)  allows consignments of raw mater ial with differin g energy content to be mixed for the purposes of further 
processing, provid ed that the size of consignments is adjuste d according to their energy content; 
(c)  requires information about the sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving character istics and sizes of the 
consignments refer red to in point (a) to remain assigned to the mixture; and 
(d) provid es for the sum of all consignments withdra wn from the mixture to be descr ibed as having the same sustain ­
ability charact eristics, in the same quantities, as the sum of all consignments added to the mixture and requires that 
this balance be achi eved over an appropr iate period of time. 
The mass balance syste m shall ensure that each consignment is counted only once in point (a), (b) or (c) of the first 
subparagraph of Article 7(1) for the purposes of calculating the gross final consump tion of energy from renewable 
sources and shall include information on whether suppor t has been provided for the production of that consignment, 
and if so, on the type of suppor t scheme. 
2. Where a consignment is processed, information on the sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving charac ­
teristic s of the consignment shall be adjusted and assigned to the output in accordance with the following rules: 
(a)  when the processing of a consignment of raw mate rial yields only one output that is intended for the production of 
biofuels, bioliquids or biomass fuels, renewable liquid and gaseous transpor t fuels of non-biological origin, or 
recy cled carbon fuels, the size of the consignment and the relat ed quantities of sustainability and greenhouse gas 
emissions saving characteri stics shall be adjusted applying a conversion factor representing the ratio between the 
mass of the output that is intended for such production and the mass of the raw mate rial entering the process; 
(b)  when the processing of a consignment of raw mater ial yields more than one output that is intended for the 
production of biofuels, bioliquids or biomass fuels, renewable liquid and gaseous transpor t fuels of non-biological 
origin, or recy cled carbon fuels, for each output a separate conver sion factor shall be applied and a separate mass 
balance shall be used. 
3. Member State s shall take measures to ensure that economic operat ors submit reliable information regarding the 
compl iance with the greenhouse gas emissions savings thresholds set in, and adopt ed pursuant to, Article 25(2), and 
with the sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria laid down in Article 29(2) to (7) and (10), and that 
economic operat ors make available to the relevant Member State, upon request, the data that were used to develop the 
information. Member States shall require economic operat ors to arrang e for an adequat e standard of independent 
auditing of the information submitted , and to provide evidence that this has been done. In order to compl y with 
point (a) of Article 29(6) and point (a) of Article 29(7), the first or second party auditing may be used up to the first 
gather ing point of the forest biomass. The auditing shall verify that the systems used by economic operators are 
accurate , reliable and protect ed against fraud, including verification ensur ing that mate rials are not intentionall y 
modified or discarded so that the consignment or part thereof could become a waste or residue. It shall evaluate the 
frequency and methodology of sam pling and the robustness of the data. 
The oblig ations laid down in this paragraph shall apply rega rdless of whether the biofuels, bioliquids, biomass fuels, 
renewable liquid and gaseous transpor t fuels of non-biological origin, or recy cled carbon fuels are produced within the 
Union or are imported. Information about the geographic origin and feedstoc k type of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass 
fuels per fuel supplier shall be made available to consumers on the website s of operat ors, suppliers or the relevant 
compet ent author ities and shall be updated on an annual basis. 21.12.2018 L 328/134 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     Member State s shall submit to the Commission, in aggregat ed form, the information refer red to in the first 
subparagraph of this paragraph. The Commission shall publish that information on the e-repor ting platf orm refer red to 
in Article 28 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 in summar y form preser ving the conf identiality of commercially sensitive 
information. 
4. The Commission may decide that voluntar y national or internati onal sche mes setting standards for the production 
of biofuels, bioliquids or biomass fuels, or other fuels that are eligible for counting towards the numerat or refer red to in 
point (b) of Article 27(1), provide accurat e data on greenhouse gas emission savings for the purposes of Article 25(2) 
and Article 29(10), demonstrate compl iance with Article 27(3) and Article 28(2) and (4), or demonstrate that 
consignments of biofuels, bioliquids or biomass fuels compl y with the sustainability criteria laid down in Article 29(2) 
to (7). When demonstrating that the criteria laid down in Article 29(6) and (7) are met, the operators may provi de the 
required evidence directly at sourcing area level. The Commission may recognise areas for the protection of rare, 
threatened or endange red ecosystems or species recognised by internatio nal agreements or included in lists drawn up by 
inter govern mental organisations or the International Union for the Conser vation of Nature for the purposes of 
point (c)(ii) of the first subparagraph of Article 29(3). 
The Commission may decide that those sche mes contain accurate information on measures taken for soil, water and air 
prote ction, for the restoration of degraded land, for the avoidance of exces sive water consum ption in areas where water 
is scarce, and for certification of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels with low indirect land-use chang e-risk. 
5. The Commission shall adopt decisions under paragraph 4 of this Article by means of implementing acts. Those 
implementing acts shall be adop ted in accordance with the examination procedure refer red to in Article 34(3). Such 
decisions shall be valid for a period of no more than five years. 
The Commission shall require that each voluntar y scheme on which a decision has been adopt ed under paragraph 4 
submit annually by 30 Apr il a repor t to the Commission cover ing each of the points set out in Annex IX to Regulation 
(EU) 2018/1999. The repor t shall cover the preceding calendar year . The requirement to submit a repor t shall apply 
only to voluntar y schemes that have operat ed for at least 12 months. 
The Commission shall make the repor ts drawn up by the voluntar y sche mes available, in an aggreg ated form or in full if 
appropr iate, on the e-repor ting platf orm refer red to in Article 28 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. 
6. Member States may set up national schemes where compl iance with the sustainability and greenhouse gas 
emissions saving criteria laid down in Article 29(2) to (7) and (10) and with the greenhouse gas emissions savings 
thresholds for renewable liquid and gaseous transpor t fuels of non-biological origin and recy cled carbon fuels set in, and 
adopt ed pursuant to, Article 25(2) and in accordance with Article 28(5) is verified throughout the entire chain of 
custody involving compet ent national author ities. 
A Member State may notify such a national sche me to the Commission. The Commission shall give priority to the 
assessment of such a scheme in order to facilitate mutual bilat eral and multilat eral recognition of schemes for 
verification of compliance with the sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria for biofuels, bioliquids 
and biomass fuels and with the greenhouse gas emissions savings thresholds for other fuels that are eligible for counting 
towards the numerator referred to in point (b) of Article 27(1). The Commission may decide, by means of implementing 
acts, whether such a notified national scheme compl ies with the conditions laid down in this Directive. Those 
implementing acts shall be adopt ed in accordance with the examination procedure refer red to in Article 34(3). 
Where the decision is positive, schemes established in accordance with this Article shall not refuse mutual recognition 
with that Member State's scheme, as regards verification of compliance with the sustainability and greenhouse gas 
emissions saving criteria laid down in Article 29(2) to (7) and (10) and the greenhouse gas emissions savings thresholds 
set in, and adopt ed pursuant to, Article 25(2). 
7. The Commission shall adopt decisions under paragraph 4 of this Article only if the scheme in question meets 
adequate standards of reliability , transparency and independent auditing and provides adequate assurances that no 21.12.2018 L 328/135 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     mate rials have been intentionally modified or discarded so that the consignment or part thereof would fall under 
Annex IX. In the case of schemes to measure greenhouse gas emissions savings, such schem es shall also compl y with the 
methodological requirements set out in Annex V or VI. Lists of areas of high biodiversity value as refer red to in 
point (c)(ii) of the first subparagraph of Article 29(3) shall meet adequate standards of objectivity and coherence with in­
ternatio nally recognised standards and provide for appropr iate appeal procedures. 
The volun tary schemes referred to in paragraph 4 shall, at least annually , publish a list of their certification bodies used 
for independent auditing, indicating for each certification body by whic h entity or national public author ity it was 
recognised and which entity or national public author ity is monitori ng it. 
8. In order to ensure that compliance with the sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria as well as 
with the provisions on low or high direct and indirect land-use change-risk biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels is 
verified in an effic ient and harmonised manner and in particular to prevent fraud, the Commission shall adopt 
implementing acts specifying detailed implementing rules, including adequate standards of reliability , transparency and 
independent auditing and require all voluntar y schemes to apply those standards. Those implementing acts shall be 
adopt ed in accordance with the examination procedure refer red to in Article 34(3). 
In those implementing acts, the Commission shall pay particular attention to the need to minimise administrative 
burden. The implementing acts shall set a time frame by whic h voluntar y schemes are required to imple ment the 
standards. The Commission may repeal decisions recognising volun tary sche mes pursuant to paragraph 4 in the event 
that those schem es fail to implement such standards in the time frame provided for. Where a Member State raises 
concer ns that a voluntar y scheme does not operate in accordance with the standards of reliability , transparency and 
independent auditing that constitute the basis for decisions under paragraph 4, the Commission shall investigat e the 
matt er and take appropr iate action. 
9. Where an economic operat or provid es evidence or data obtained in accordance with a scheme that has been the 
subject of a decision pursuant to paragraph 4 or 6 of this Article, to the exte nt covered by that decision, a Member State 
shall not require the supplier to provide further evidence of compl iance with the sustainability and greenhouse gas 
emissions saving criteria laid down in Article 29(2) to (7) and (10). 
Com petent author ities of the Member States shall super vise the operation of certification bodies that are conducting 
independent auditing under a voluntar y schem e. Certificat ion bodies shall submit, upon the request of compet ent 
author ities, all relevant information necessar y to super vise the operation, including the exact date, time and location of 
audits. Where Member States find issues of non-conf ormity , they shall inform the voluntary scheme without dela y. 
10. At the request of a Member State , which may be based on the request of an economic operat or, the Commission 
shall, on the basis of all available evidence, examine whether the sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving 
criteria laid down in Article 29(2) to (7) and (10) in relation to a source of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels, and 
the greenhouse gas emissions savings thresholds set in, and adopt ed pursuant to, Article 25(2), have been met. 
Within six months of receipt of such a request and in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in 
Article 34(3), the Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, decide whether the Member State concer ned may 
either: 
(a)  take into account biofuels, bioliquids, biomass fuels and other fuels that are eligible for counting towards the 
numerator refer red to in point (b) of Article 27(1) from that source for the purposes refer red to in points (a), (b) 
and (c) of the first subparagraph of Article 29(1); or 
(b)  by way of derogat ion from paragraph 9 of this Article, require suppliers of the source of biofuels, bioliquids, 
biomass fuels and other fuels that are eligible for counting towards the numerat or refer red to in point (b) of 
Article 27(1) to provid e further evidence of compl iance with those sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions 
saving criteria and those greenhouse gas emissions savings thresholds. 21.12.2018 L 328/136 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     Article 31 
Calculation of the greenhouse gas impact of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels 
1. For the purposes of Article 29(10), the greenhouse gas emissions saving from the use of biofuel, bioliquids and 
biomass fuels shall be calculated in one of the followi ng ways: 
(a)  where a default value for greenhouse gas emissions saving for the production pathwa y is laid down in Part A or B of

1.  Greenhouse gas emissions from the production and use of transpor t fuels, biofuels and bioliquids shall be calculated 
as follows: 
(a)  greenhouse gas emissions from the production and use of biofuels shall be calculat ed as: 
E = eec + el + ep + etd + eu – esca – eccs – eccr, 
where 
E = tota l emissions from the use of the fuel; 
eec = emissions from the extraction or cultivation of raw mater ials; 
el = annualised emissions from carbon stoc k chang es caused by land-use change ; 
ep = emissions from processing; 
etd = emissions from transpor t and distr ibution; 
eu = emissions from the fuel in use; 
esca = emission savings from soil carbon accumulation via impro ved agricultural manag ement ; 
eccs = emission savings from CO2 capture and geological storage; and 
eccr = emission savings from CO2 capture and replacement.  
Emissions from the manufacture of machi nery and equipment shall not be take n into account. 
(b)  Greenhouse gas emissions from the production and use of bioliquids shall be calculat ed as for biofuels (E), but 
with the extension necessar y for including the energy conversion to electr icity and/or heat and cooling 
produced, as follo ws: 
(i)  For energy installations deliver ing only heat: 
EC h¼E

(ii)  For energy installations deliver ing only electr icity: 
EC el¼E
ηel 
where 
ECh,el  =Total greenhouse gas emissions from the final energy commodity . 
E  =Total greenhouse gas emissions of the bioliquid before end-conver sion. 
ηel  =The electr ical efficiency , defined as the annual electr icity produced divided by the annual 
bioliquid input based on its energy content. 
ηh  =The heat efficiency , defined as the annual useful heat output divided by the annual bioliquid 
input based on its energy conte nt.

ηel  =The electr ical efficiency , defined as the annual electr icity produced divided by the annual fuel 
input based on its energy conte nt. 
ηh  =The heat efficiency , defined as the annual useful heat output divided by the annual fuel input 
based on its energy content. 
Cel  =Fraction of exergy in the electr icity , and/or mechanical energy , set to 100 % (Cel = 1). 
Ch  =Carnot efficiency (fraction of exer gy in the useful heat). 
The Carnot efficiency , Ch, for useful heat at differ ent temperatures is defined as: 
Ch¼Th − T 0
Th 
where 
Th  =Temperature, measured in absolute temperature (kelvin) of the useful heat at point of deliver y. 
T0  =Temperature of surroundings, set at 273,15 kelv in (equal to 0 °C) 
If the exce ss heat is expor ted for heating of buildings, at a temperature below 150 °C (423,15 kelv in), Ch can 
alternati vely be defined as follows: 
Ch  =Carnot efficiency in heat at 150 °C (423,15 kelv in), whic h is: 0,3546 
For the purposes of that calculation, the following definitions apply: 
(a)  ‘cog eneration’ means the simultaneous generation in one process of ther mal energy and electr icity and/or 
mechanical energy ; 
(b)  ‘useful heat’ means heat generat ed to satisfy an economical justif iable demand for heat, for heating and cooling 
purposes; 
(c)  ‘economically justifiable demand’ means the demand that does not exceed the needs for heat or cooling and 
which would other wise be satisfied at mark et conditions. 
2.  Greenhouse gas emissions from biofuels and bioliquids shall be expressed as follows : 
(a)  greenhouse gas emissions from biofuels, E, shall be expressed in terms of grams of CO2 equivalent per MJ of 
fuel, g CO2eq/MJ. 
(b)  greenhouse gas emissions from bioliquids, EC, in term s of grams of CO2 equivalent per MJ of final energy 
commodity (heat or electr icity), g CO2eq/MJ. 
When heating and cooling are co-ge nerated with electr icity , emissions shall be allocat ed between heat and electr icity 
(as under 1(b)), irrespective if the heat is used for actual heating purposes or for cooling (1). 21.12.2018 L 328/151 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     
(1)Heat or wast e heat is used to generat e cooling (chilled air or water) through absor ption chillers. Theref ore, it is appropr iate to calculate 
only the emissions associated to the heat produced per MJ of heat, irrespectively if the end-use of the heat is actual heating or cooling via 
absor ption chillers. Where the greenhouse gas emissions from the extraction or cultivation of raw mater ials eec are expressed in unit g 
CO2eq/dr y-ton of feedstoc k, the conversion to grams of CO2 equivalent per MJ of fuel, g CO2eq/MJ, shall be

3.  Greenhouse gas emissions savings from biofuels and bioliquids shall be calculat ed as follo ws: 
(a)  greenhouse gas emissions savings from biofuels: 
SAVING = (EF(t) – EB)/EF(t), 
where 
EB = total emissions from the biofuel; and 
EF(t) = total emissions from the fossil fuel comparat or for transpor t  
(b)  greenhouse gas emissions savings from heat and cooling, and electr icity being generated from bioliquids: 
SAVING = (ECF(h&c,el) – ECB(h&c,el) )/ECF(h&c,el) , 
where 
ECB(h&c,el)  =tota l emissions from the heat or electr icity ; and 
ECF(h&c,el)  =tota l emissions from the fossil fuel comparat or for useful heat or electr icity . 
4.  The greenhouse gases taken into account for the purposes of point 1 shall be CO2, N2O and CH4. For the purposes 
of calculating CO2 equivalence, those gases shall be valued as follows: 
CO2 :  1 
N2O :  298 
CH4 :  25  
5.  Emissions from the extraction or cultivation of raw mater ials, eec, shall include emissions from the extraction or 
cultivation process itself; from the collection, drying and storage of raw mate rials; from waste and leakages; and 
from the production of chemicals or products used in extraction or cultivation. Capt ure of CO2 in the cultivation of 
raw mate rials shall be excl uded. Estimate s of emissions from agriculture biomass cultivation may be derived from 21.12.2018 L 328/152 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     
(1)The formula for calculating greenhouse gas emissions from the extraction or cultivation of raw material s eec descr ibes cases where 
feed stoc k is conver ted into biofuels in one step. For more com plex supply chains, adjustments are needed for calculating greenhouse gas 
emissions from the extraction or cultivation of raw mat erials eec for intermediate products. the use of regional averages for cultivation emissions included in the repor ts referred to in Article 31(4) or the 
information on the disaggregat ed defa ult values for cultivation emissions included in this Annex, as an altern ative to 
using actual values. In the absence of relevant information in those repor ts it is allowed to calculate averages based 
on local farming practises based for instance on data of a group of farms, as an alternative to using actual values. 
6.  For the purposes of the calculation refer red to in point 1(a), greenhouse gas emissions savings from improved 
agriculture management , esca, such as shifting to reduced or zero-tillag e, improved crop/rotation, the use of cover 
crops, including crop residue manag ement, and the use of orga nic soil improver (e.g. compost, manure 
fermentation digestat e), shall be taken into account only if solid and verifiable evidence is provi ded that the soil 
carbon has increased or that it is reasonable to expect to have increased over the period in whic h the raw mate rials 
concer ned were cultivate d while taking into account the emissions where such practices lead to increased fertiliser 
and herbicide use (1). 
7.  Annualised emissions from carbon stoc k change s caused by land-use change, el, shall be calculated by dividing total 
emissions equally over 20 years. For the calculation of those emissions, the followi ng rule shall be applied: 
el = (CSR – CSA) × 3,664 × 1/20 × 1/P – eB, (2) 
where 
el = annualised greenhouse gas emissions from carbon stoc k change due to land-use chang e (measured as 
mass (grams) of CO2-equivalent per unit of biofuel or bioliquid energy (mega joules)). ‘Cropland’ (3) and 
‘perennial cropland’ (4) shall be regarded as one land use; 
CSR = the carbon stoc k per unit area associated with the reference land-use (measured as mass (tonnes) of car­
bon per unit area, including both soil and vege tation). The reference land-use shall be the land-use in 
Januar y 2008 or 20 years before the raw mater ial was obtained, whichever was the later; 
CSA = the carbon stoc k per unit area associated with the actual land-use (measured as mass (tonnes) of carbon 
per unit area, including both soil and vegetation). In cases where the carbon stoc k accumulate s over 
more than one year , the value attribut ed to CSA shall be the estimated stoc k per unit area after 20 years 
or when the crop reach es matur ity, whic hever the earlier; 
P = the productivity of the crop (measured as biofuel or bioliquid energy per unit area per year) and 
eB = bonus of 29 g CO2eq/MJ biofuel or bioliquid if biomass is obtained from restored degraded land under 
the conditions laid down in point 8.  
8.  The bonus of 29 g CO2eq/MJ shall be attribut ed if evidence is provided that the land: 
(a)  was not in use for agriculture or any other activity in Januar y 2008; and 
(b)  is severely degraded land, including such land that was formerly in agricultural use. 
The bonus of 29 g CO2eq/MJ shall apply for a period of up to 20 years from the date of conversion of the land to 
agricultural use, provided that a steady increase in carbon stoc ks as well as a sizable reduction in erosion 
phenomena for land falling under (b) are ensured. 21.12.2018 L 328/153 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     
(1)Measurements of soil carbon can constitute such evidence, e.g. by a first measurement in advance of the cultivation and subsequent ones 
at regular inter vals several years apar t. In such a case, before the second measurement is available, increase in soil carbon would be 
estimat ed on the basis of representative exper iments or soil models. From the second measurement onwards, the measurements would 
constitute the basis for deter mining the existen ce of an increase in soil carbon and its magnitude. 
(2)The quotient obtained by dividing the molecular weight of CO2 (44,010 g/mol) by the molecular weight of carbon (12,011 g/mol) is 
equal to 3,664. 
(3)Cropland as defin ed by IPCC. 
(4)Perennial crops are defined as multi-annual crops, the stem of whic h is usually not annually harvested such as shor t rotation 
coppice and oil palm. 9.  ‘Severely degraded land’ means land that, for a significant period of time, has either been signif icantly salinate d or 
present ed signif icantly low organic matt er content and has been severely eroded. 
10.  The Commission shall review , by 31 December 2020, guidelines for the calculation of land carbon stoc ks (1) 
drawing on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Invent ories – volume 4 and in accordance with 
Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 and Regulation (EU) 2018/841 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2). 
The Commission guidelines shall serve as the basis for the calculation of land carbon stoc ks for the purposes of this 
Directive. 
11.  Emissions from processing, ep, shall include emissions from the processing itself; from waste and leakages; and from 
the production of chemicals or products used in processing including the CO2 emissions corresponding to the 
carbon cont ents of fossil inputs, whether or not actually combusted in the process. 
In accounting for the consum ption of electr icity not produced within the fuel production plant, the greenhouse gas 
emissions intensit y of the production and distr ibution of that electr icity shall be assumed to be equal to the averag e 
emission intensity of the production and distr ibution of electr icity in a defined region. By way of derogation from 
this rule, producers may use an averag e value for an individual electr icity production plant for electr icity produced 
by that plant, if that plant is not connected to the electr icity grid. 
Emissions from processing shall include emissions from drying of interi m products and mater ials where relevant. 
12.  Emissions from transpor t and distr ibution, etd, shall include emissions from the transpor t of raw and semi-fi nished 
mate rials and from the storag e and distr ibution of finished mater ials. Emissions from transpor t and distr ibution to 
be taken into account under point 5 shall not be covered by this point. 
13.  Emissions of the fuel in use, eu, shall be take n to be zero for biofuels and bioliquids. 
Emissions of non-CO2 greenhouse gases (N2O and CH4) of the fuel in use shall be included in the eu factor for 
bioliquids. 
14.  Emission savings from CO2 captur e and geological storage, eccs, that have not already been accounte d for in ep, shall 
be limited to emissions avoided through the capture and storage of emitted CO2 directly related to the extraction, 
transpor t, processing and distr ibution of fuel if stored in compl iance with Directive 2009/31/EC of the European 
Parliament and of the Council (3). 
15.  Emission savings from CO2 capture and replacement, eccr, shall be relat ed directly to the production of biofuel or 
bioliquid they are attributed to, and shall be limited to emissions avoided through the capture of CO2 of whic h the 
carbon originates from biomass and which is used to replace fossil-der ived CO2 in production of commercial 
products and services. 
16.  Where a cogener ation unit – providing heat and/or electr icity to a fuel production process for whic h emissions are 
being calculat ed – produces exces s electr icity and/or exces s useful heat, the greenhouse gas emissions shall be 
divided between the electr icity and the useful heat according to the temperature of the heat (which reflects the 
usefulness (utility) of the heat). The useful part of the heat is found by multiplying its energy cont ent with the 
Carnot efficiency , Ch, calculat ed as follows: 
Ch¼Th − T 0
Th 
where 
Th  =Temperature, measured in absolute temperature (kelvin) of the useful heat at point of deliver y. 
T0  =Temperature of surroundings, set at 273,15 kelv in (equal to 0 °C) 21.12.2018 L 328/154 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

2006/12/EC, 2008/1/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 (OJ L 140, 5.6.2009, p. 114). If the exce ss heat is expor ted for heating of buildings, at a temperature below 150 °C (423,15 kelv in), Ch can 
alternati vely be defined as follows: 
Ch  =Carnot efficiency in heat at 150 °C (423,15 kelv in), whic h is: 0,3546 
For the purposes of that calculation, the actual efficiencies shall be used, defined as the annual mec hanical energy , 
electr icity and heat produced respectively divided by the annual energy input. 
For the purposes of that calculation, the following definitions apply: 
(a)  ‘cog eneration’ shall mean the simultaneous generation in one process of ther mal energy and electr ical and/or 
mechanical energy ; 
(b)  ‘useful heat’ shall mean heat generated to satisfy an economical justif iable demand for heat, for heating or 
cooling purposes; 
(c)  ‘economically justif iable demand’ shall mean the demand that does not exceed the needs for heat or cooling and 
which would other wise be satisfied at mark et conditions. 
17.  Where a fuel production process produces, in combination, the fuel for which emissions are being calculated and 
one or more other products (co-products), greenhouse gas emissions shall be divided between the fuel or its 
interm ediat e product and the co-products in propor tion to their energy content (determined by lower heating value 
in the case of co-products other than electr icity and heat). The greenhouse gas intensi ty of exce ss useful heat or 
excess electr icity is the same as the greenhouse gas intensi ty of heat or electr icity delivered to the fuel production 
process and is determined from calculating the greenhouse intensity of all inputs and emissions, including the 
feedstoc k and CH4 and N2O emissions, to and from the cogeneration unit, boiler or other apparatus deliver ing heat 
or electr icity to the fuel production process. In the case of cogener ation of electr icity and heat, the calculation is 
performed follo wing point 16. 
18.  For the purposes of the calculation refer red to in point 17, the emissions to be divided shall be eec + el + esca + those 
fractions of ep, etd, eccs, and eccr that take place up to and including the process step at which a co-product is 
produced. If any allocation to co-products has take n place at an earlier process step in the life-cy cle, the fraction of 
those emissions assigned in the last such process step to the interm ediate fuel product shall be used for those 
purposes instead of the total of those emissions. 
In the case of biofuels and bioliquids, all co-products shall be taken into account for the purposes of that 
calculation. No emissions shall be allocat ed to waste s and residues. Co-products that have a negative energy conte nt 
shall be considered to have an energy content of zero for the purposes of the calculation. 
Wastes and residues, including tree tops and branches, straw, husks, cobs and nut shells, and residues from 
processing, including crude glycerine (glycerine that is not refined) and baga sse, shall be considered to have zero 
life-cy cle greenhouse gas emissions up to the process of collection of those mater ials irrespectively of whether they 
are processed to interi m products before being transf ormed into the final product. 
In the case of fuels produced in refiner ies, other than the combination of processing plants with boilers or 
cogener ation units providin g heat and/or electr icity to the processing plant, the unit of analysis for the purposes of 
the calculation refer red to in point 17 shall be the refiner y. 
19.  For biofuels, for the purposes of the calculation refer red to in point 3, the fossil fuel comparat or EF(t) shall be 94 g

(1)The values for biogas production from manure include negative emissions for emissions saved from raw manure management. The 
value of esca considered is equal to – 45 g CO2eq/MJ manure used in anaerobic digestion. 
(2)Open storag e of diges tate accounts for additional emissions of CH4 and N2O. The magnitude of those emissions chang es with 
ambient conditions, substrate types and the diges tion efficiency . 
(3)Close storag e means that the digestat e resulting from the digestion process is stored in a gas‑tight tank and that the additional 
bioga s released during storage is considered to be recovered for production of additional electr icity or biomethane. No greenhouse 
gas emissions are included in that process.

2.  Greenhouse gas emissions from biomass fuels shall be expressed as follows : 
(a)  greenhouse gas emissions from biomass fuels, E, shall be expressed in term s of grams of CO2 equivalent per MJ 
of biomass fuel, g CO2eq/MJ; 
(b)  greenhouse gas emissions from heating or electr icity , produced from biomass fuels, EC, shall be expressed in 
term s of grams of CO2 equivalent per MJ of final energy commodity (heat or electr icity), g CO2eq/MJ. 
When heating and cooling are co-ge nerated with electr icity , emissions shall be allocat ed between heat and electr icity

SAVING = (EF(t) – EB)/EF(t) 
where 
EB  =total emissions from biomass fuels used as transpor t fuels; and

ECF(h&c,el)  =tota l emissions from the fossil fuel comparat or for useful heat or electr icity . 
4.  The greenhouse gases taken into account for the purposes of point 1 shall be CO2, N2O and CH4. For the purposes 
of calculating CO2 equivalence, those gases shall be valued as follows: 
CO2: 1 
N2O: 298 
CH4: 25 
5.  Emissions from the extraction, harvesting or cultivation of raw mater ials, eec, shall include emissions from the 
extraction, harvesting or cultivation process itself; from the collection, drying and storage of raw mate rials; from 
waste and leakages; and from the production of chemicals or products used in extraction or cultivation. Cap ture of 
CO2 in the cultivation of raw mater ials shall be excl uded. Estimates of emissions from agriculture biomass 
cultivation may be derived from the regional averages for cultivation emissions included in the repor ts refer red to in 
Article 31(4) of this Directive or the information on the disaggregat ed defa ult values for cultivation emissions 
included in this Annex, as an altern ative to using actual values. In the absence of relevant information in those 
repor ts it is allowed to calculat e averages based on local farming practises based for instance on data of a group of 
farms, as an altern ative to using actual values. 
Estimates of emissions from cultivation and harvesting of forestr y biomass may be derived from the use of averages 
for cultivation and harvesting emissions calculated for geographical areas at national level, as an altern ative to using 
actual values. 21.12.2018 L 328/183 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     
(1)The formula for calculating greenhouse gas emissions from the extraction or cultivation of raw mat erials eec descr ibes cases where 
feed stoc k is conver ted into biofuels in one step. For more com plex supply chains, adjustments are needed for calculating greenhouse gas 
emissions from the extraction or cultivation of raw mat erials eec for inter mediat e products. 6.  For the purposes of the calculation referred to in point 1(a), emission savings from imp roved agriculture 
manage ment, esca, such as shifting to reduced or zero-tillag e, impro ved crop/rotation, the use of cover crops, 
including crop residue manag ement, and the use of organic soil improver (e.g. compo st, manure fermentation 
dige state), shall be taken into account only if solid and verifiable evidence is provided that the soil carbon has 
increased or that it is reasonable to expect to have increased over the period in which the raw mat erials concer ned 
were cultivated while taking into account the emissions where such practices lead to increased fertiliser and 
herbicide use (1). 
7.  Annualised emissions from carbon stoc k change s caused by land-use change, el, shall be calculated by dividing total 
emissions equally over 20 years. For the calculation of those emissions the followi ng rule shall be applied: 
el = (CSR – CSA) × 3,664 × 1/20 × 1/P – eB, (2) 
where 
el  =annualised greenhouse gas emissions from carbon stoc k chang e due to land-use chang e (measured as mass 
of CO2-equivalent per unit biomass fuel energy). ‘Cropland’ (3) and ‘perennial cropland’ (4) shall be 
regar ded as one land use; 
CSR  =the carbon stock per unit area associated with the reference land use (measured as mass (tonnes) of carbon 
per unit area, including both soil and vege tation). The reference land use shall be the land use in Januar y 
2008 or 20 years before the raw mate rial was obtained, whic hever was the later; 
CSA  =the carbon stoc k per unit area associated with the actual land use (measured as mass (tonnes) of carbon 
per unit area, including both soil and veget ation). In cases where the carbon stoc k accumulates over more 
than one year, the value attributed to CSA shall be the estimated stoc k per unit area after 20 years or when 
the crop reaches matur ity, which ever the earlier; 
P  =the productivity of the crop (measured as biomass fuel energy per unit area per year); and 
eB  =bonus of 29 g CO2eq/MJ biomass fuel if biomass is obtained from restored degraded land under the 
conditions laid down in point 8. 
8.  The bonus of 29 g CO2eq/MJ shall be attribut ed if evidence is provided that the land: 
(a)  was not in use for agriculture in Januar y 2008 or any other activity ; and 
(b)  is severely degraded land, including such land that was formerly in agricultural use. 
The bonus of 29 g CO2eq/MJ shall apply for a period of up to 20 years from the date of conversion of the land to 
agricultural use, provided that a steady increase in carbon stoc ks as well as a sizable reduction in erosion 
phenomena for land falling under (b) are ensured. 
9.  ‘Severely degraded land’ means land that, for a significant period of time, has either been signif icantly salinate d or 
present ed signif icantly low organic matt er content and has been severely eroded. 
10.  In accordance with point 10 of Part C of Annex V to this Directive, Commission Decision 2010/335/EU (5), which 
provid es for guidelines for the calculation of land carbon stoc ks in relation to this Directive, drawing on the 2006 
IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventor ies – volume 4, and in accordance with Regulations (EU) 
No 525/2013 and (EU) 2018/841, shall serve as the basis for the calculation of land carbon stoc ks. 21.12.2018 L 328/184 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     
(1)Measurements of soil carbon can constitute such evidence, e.g. by a first measurement in advance of the cultivation and subsequent ones 
at regular inter vals several years apar t. In such a case, before the second measurement is available, increase in soil carbon would be 
estimat ed on the basis of representative exper iments or soil models. From the second measurement onwards, the measurements would 
constitute the basis for deter mining the existen ce of an increase in soil carbon and its magnitude. 
(2)The quotient obtained by dividing the molecular weight of CO2 (44,010 g/mol) by the molecular weight of carbon (12,011 g/mol) is 
equal to 3,664. 
(3)Cropland as defin ed by IPCC. 
(4)Perennial crops are defin ed as multi-annual crops, the stem of which is usually not annually harvest ed such as shor t rotation coppice and 
oil palm. 
(5)Commission Decision 2010/335/EU of 10 June 2010 on guidelines for the calculation of land carbon stoc ks for the purpose of Annex V 
to Directive 2009/28/EC (OJ L 151, 17.6.2010, p. 19). 11.  Emissions from processing, ep, shall include emissions from the processing itself; from waste and leakages; and from 
the production of chemicals or products used in processing, including the CO2 emissions corresponding to the 
carbon cont ents of fossil inputs, whether or not actually combusted in the process. 
In accounting for the consum ption of electr icity not produced within the solid or gaseo us biomass fuel production 
plant, the greenhouse gas emissions intensit y of the production and distr ibution of that electr icity shall be assumed 
to be equal to the averag e emission intensity of the production and distr ibution of electr icity in a defined region. By 
way of derogation from this rule, producers may use an average value for an individual electr icity production plant 
for electr icity produced by that plant, if that plant is not connected to the electr icity grid. 
Emissions from processing shall include emissions from drying of interi m products and mater ials where relevant. 
12.  Emissions from transpor t and distr ibution, etd, shall include emissions from the transpor t of raw and semi-fi nished 
mate rials and from the storag e and distr ibution of finished mater ials. Emissions from transpor t and distr ibution to 
be taken into account under point 5 shall not be covered by this point. 
13.  Emissions of CO2 from fuel in use, eu, shall be taken to be zero for biomass fuels. Emissions of non-C O2 greenhouse 
gases (CH4 and N2O) from the fuel in use shall be included in the eu factor . 
14.  Emission savings from CO2 captur e and geological storage, eccs, that have not already been accounte d for in ep, shall 
be limited to emissions avoided through the capture and storage of emitted CO2 directly related to the extraction, 
transpor t, processing and distr ibution of biomass fuel if store d in compl iance with Directive 2009/31/EC. 
15.  Emission savings from CO2 captur e and replacement, eccr, shall be relat ed directly to the production of biomass fuel 
they are attribut ed to, and shall be limited to emissions avoided through the capture of CO2 of which the carbon 
originates from biomass and whic h is used to replace fossil-der ived CO2 in production of commercial products and 
services. 
16.  Where a cogener ation unit – providing heat and/or electr icity to a biomass fuel production process for whic h 
emissions are being calculated – produces excess electr icity and/or exce ss useful heat, the greenhouse gas emissions 
shall be divided between the electr icity and the useful heat according to the temperature of the heat (whic h reflects 
the usefulness (utility) of the heat). The useful part of the heat is found by multiplying its energy content with the 
Carnot efficiency , Ch, calculat ed as follows: 
Ch¼Th − T 0
Th 
where 
Th  =Temperature, measured in absolute temperature (kelvin) of the useful heat at point of deliver y. 
T0  =Temperature of surroundings, set at 273,15 kelv in (equal to 0 °C). 
If the exce ss heat is expor ted for heating of buildings, at a temperature below 150 °C (423,15 kelv in), Ch can 
alternati vely be defined as follows: 
Ch  =Carnot efficiency in heat at 150 °C (423,15 kelv in), whic h is: 0,3546 
For the purposes of that calculation, the actual efficiencies shall be used, defined as the annual mec hanical energy , 
electr icity and heat produced respectively divided by the annual energy input. 
For the purposes of that calculation, the following definitions apply: 
(a)  ‘cog eneration’ shall mean the simultaneous generation in one process of ther mal energy and electr ical and/or 
mechanical energy ; 
(b)  ‘useful heat’ shall mean heat generated to satisfy an economical justif iable demand for heat, for heating or 
cooling purposes; 
(c)  ‘economically justif iable demand’ shall mean the demand that does not exceed the needs for heat or cooling and 
which would other wise be satisfied at mark et conditions. 21.12.2018 L 328/185 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     17.  Where a biomass fuel production process produces, in combination, the fuel for which emissions are being 
calculat ed and one or more other products (‘co-products’), greenhouse gas emissions shall be divided between the 
fuel or its interm ediate product and the co-products in propor tion to their energy cont ent (determined by lowe r 
heating value in the case of co-products other than electr icity and heat). The greenhouse gas intensity of excess 
useful heat or excess electr icity is the same as the greenhouse gas intensi ty of heat or electr icity delivered to the 
biomass fuel production process and is deter mined from calculating the greenhouse gas intensity of all inputs and 
emissions, including the feedstoc k and CH4 and N2O emissions, to and from the cogeneration unit, boiler or other 
apparatus deliver ing heat or electr icity to the biomass fuel production process. In the case of cogener ation of 
electr icity and heat, the calculation is performe d followi ng point 16. 
18.  For the purposes of the calculations refer red to in point 17, the emissions to be divided shall be eec + el + esca + 
those fractions of ep, etd, eccs and eccr that take place up to and including the process step at whic h a co-product is 
produced. If any allocation to co-products has take n place at an earlier process step in the life-cy cle, the fraction of 
those emissions assigned in the last such process step to the interm ediate fuel product shall be used for those 
purposes instead of the total of those emissions. 
In the case of biogas and biomethane, all co-products that do not fall under the scope of point 7 shall be taken into 
account for the purposes of that calculation. No emissions shall be allocat ed to wastes and residues. Co-products 
that have a negative energy conte nt shall be considered to have an energy conte nt of zero for the purposes of the 
calculation. 
Wastes and residues, including tree tops and branches, straw, husks, cobs and nut shells, and residues from 
processing, including crude glycerine (glycerine that is not refined) and baga sse, shall be considered to have zero 
life-cy cle greenhouse gas emissions up to the process of collection of those mater ials irrespectively of whether they 
are processed to interi m products before being transf ormed into the final product. 
In the case of biomass fuels produced in refiner ies, other than the combination of processing plants with boilers or 
cogener ation units providin g heat and/or electr icity to the processing plant, the unit of analysis for the purposes of 
the calculation refer red to in point 17 shall be the refiner y. 
19.  For biomass fuels used for the production of electr icity , for the purposes of the calculation refer red to in point 3, 
the fossil fuel comparat or ECF(el) shall be 183 g CO2eq/MJ electr icity or 212 g CO2eq/MJ electr icity for the outermost 
regions. 
For biomass fuels used for the production of useful heat, as well as for the production of heating and/or cooling, 
for the purposes of the calculation refer red to in point 3, the fossil fuel compar ator ECF(h) shall be 80 g CO2eq/MJ 
heat. 
For biomass fuels used for the production of useful heat, in whic h a direct physical substitution of coal can be 
demonstrated , for the purposes of the calculation referred to in point 3, the fossil fuel compar ator ECF(h) shall be 
124 g CO2eq/MJ heat. 
For biomass fuels used as transpor t fuels, for the purposes of the calculation refer red to in point 3, the fossil fuel 
compara tor EF(t) shall be 94 g CO2eq/MJ.   21.12.2018 L 328/186 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     C.DISA GGREGA TED DEF AULT VALUES FOR BIOMASS FUELS

Case 1 refers to pathwa ys in which electr icity and heat required in the process are supplied by the CHP engine itself. 
Case 2 refers to pathwa ys in whic h the electr icity required in the process is taken from the grid and the process heat is 
supplied by the CHP engine itself. In some Member States, operat ors are not allowed to claim the gross production for 
subsidies and case 1 is the more likely conf iguration. 
Case 3 refers to pathwa ys in whic h the electr icity required in the process is taken from the grid and the process heat is 
supplied by a biogas boiler . This case applies to some installations in whic h the CHP engine is not on-site and biogas is 
sold (but not upgraded to biomethane).

ACCOU NTING OF ENER GY FROM HEA T PUMPS 
The amount of aerother mal, geother mal or hydrother mal energy captured by heat pumps to be considered to be energy 
from renewable sources for the purposes of this Directive, ERES, shall be calculat ed in accordance with the followi ng 
formula: 
ERES = Qusable * (1 – 1/SPF) 
where  
— Qusable =the estimate d total usable heat delivered by heat pumps fulfilling the criteria refer red to in Article 7(4), 
implemented as follows: Only heat pumps for which SPF > 1,15 * 1/η shall be taken into account,  
— SPF =the estimat ed averag e seasonal performa nce factor for those heat pumps,  
— η=the ratio between total gross production of electr icity and the primar y energy consum ption for the production 
of electr icity and shall be calculated as an EU average based on Eurostat data.  21.12.2018 L 328/202 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     ANNEX VIII

ARE CONSIDERED TO BE ZER O 
Biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels produced from the followi ng feedstoc k categor ies will be considered to have 
estimate d indirect land-use chang e emissions of zero:  
(1) feedst ocks whic h are not listed under part A of this Annex.  
(2) feedst ocks, the production of which has led to direct land-use change, namely , a change from one of the followi ng 
IPCC land cover categor ies: forest land, grassland, wetlands, settlements, or other land, to cropland or perennial 
cropland (4). In such a case a direct land-use change emission value (el) should have been calculat ed in accordance 
with point 7 of part C of Annex V.  21.12.2018 L 328/203 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     
(1)The mean values repor ted here represent a weighted averag e of the individually modelled feed stoc k values. The magnitude of the values 
in the Annex is sensitive to the range of assum ptions (such as treatment of co-products, yield developments, carbon stocks and 
displacement of other commodities) used in the economic models developed for their estimation. Although it is theref ore not possible to 
fully character ise the uncer tainty range associated with such estimates, a sensitivity analysis conducted on the results based on a random 
variation of key paramet ers, a so-called Monte Carlo analysis, was conducted. 
(2)The mean values included here represent a weighted averag e of the individually modelled feed stoc k values. 
(3)The range included here reflects 90 % of the results using the fifth and ninety-fif th percentile values resulting from the analysis. The 
fifth percentile sugges ts a value below whic h 5 % of the obser vations were found (namely , 5 % of total data used show ed results 
below 8, 4, and 33 g CO2eq/MJ). The ninety-fif th percentile suggests a value belo w which 95 % of the obser vations were found 
(namely , 5 % of total data used showed results above 16, 17, and 66 g CO2eq/MJ). 
(4)Perennial crops are defin ed as multi-annual crops, the stem of which is usually not annually harvest ed such as shor t rotation coppice and 
oil palm. ANNEX IX

COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN 
PARLIAMENT, THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL, THE COUNCIL, THE EUROPEAN 
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE OF THE 
REGIONS  
REPowerEU Plan  
{SWD(2022)  230 final}    
1 Introduction  
Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Ukraine, has massively 
disrupt ed the world’s energy system . It has caused hardship as a result of  high energy prices 
and it has heightened energy security concerns, bringing to the fore the EU’s  over-dependence 
on gas, oil and coal imports from Russia. High amounts paid for Russia’s fossil fuels are 
helping Russia sustain  its war against Ukraine.   
In March 2022 , EU leaders agreed in the European Council1 to phase out Europe’s dependenc y 
on Russian energy imports as soon as possible . Drawing on the Commission’s c ommunication2, 
they invited the Commission to swiftly put forward a detailed REPowerEU plan . Coal and oil 
imports are now to be covered by the sanctions regime. The recent gas supply interruptions to 
Bulgaria  and Poland  demonstrate the urgency to address the lack of reliability of Russian 
energy supplies .  
REPower EU is about rapidly reducing our dependence on Russian fossil fuels by fast 
forwarding the clean transition and joining forces to achieve a more resilient energy  
system and a true Energy Union .  
We can significantly reduce our dependency on Russian fossil fuels already this year , and 
accelerate the energy transition.  Building on the Fit for 55 package of proposals and c ompleting 
the actions on energy security of supply and storage, this REPowerEU  plan puts forward a n 
additional  set of actions to3:  
 save energy ;  
 diversify supplies ;  
 quickly su bstitut e fossil fuels by accelerating Europe’s clean energy  transition ;  
 smartly combin e investments and reforms.

COM(2022) 108 final, (8.3.2022)  
3  See the complete list of actions in Annex 1  
 
2 Taken together, t hese action s will structurally transform EU’s energy system . They  require 
effective coordinat ion between European regulat ory and infrastructure  measures , as well as  
national investment and reforms  and joined -up energy diplomacy . They also require 
coordination between action  on the demand side, to reduce energy consumption and transform 
industrial processes to replace gas, oil and coal with renewable electricity and fossil -free 
hydrogen , with action on the supply side to create the capacity and framework to roll out and 
produ ce renewable . 
Fairness and solidarity are defining principles of the European Green Deal.  Our joint action to 
accelerate the clean energy transition therefore reinforces the need for effective employment, 
skills and social policies, in line with the Europe an Pillar of Social Rights .Dependence amongst 
Member States on Russian energy sources differs as the energy situationand energy mixes 
differ from one country to the other. The approach taken in this REPowerEU plan reflects these 
differences and proposes a variety of balanced responses corresponding to the specific Member 
States needs whilst moving the EU as a whole towards climate neutrality by 2050.  
REPower EU builds on the full implementation of the Fit for 55 proposals tabled last year 
without modifying t he ambition of achieving at least -55 % net GHG emissions by 2030  and 
climate neutrality by 2050 in line with the European Green Deal . It will have a positive impact 
on EU’s  emission reduction o ver the decade. However, the fast phasing out of fossil fuel 
imports from Russia will affect the transition trajectory, or how we reach our climate target, 
compared to that under previous assumptions.  
The REPowerEU p lan cannot work without a fast implementation of all Fit for 55 proposals 
and higher targets for renewables and energy efficiency. In the new reality, t he EU’s gas 
consumption will reduce at a faster pace, limiting the role of gas as a transitional fuel . However , 
shifting away from Russian fossil fuels will also require targeted in vestments for security of 
supply  in gas  infrastructure  and very limited changes to oil infrastructure alongside large -scale 
investments in the electricity grid and an EU -wide hydrogen backbone. In parallel, some of the 
existing coal capacities might also b e used longer than initially expected, w ith a role for nuclear 
power  and domestic  gas resources too.  
The public  expect s the EU and its Member States to follow through on the commitment s made  
to reduce our dependence on Russian fossil fuels. 85% of people polled  believe  that the EU 
should reduce its dependency on Russian gas and oil as soon as possible. 84%  agree that 
Russia’s aggression against  Ukraine makes it more urgent for EU Member State s to invest in 
renewable energy4. 
While some Member States have already announced their intention to end fossil fuel imports 
from Russia , no Member State can tackle this challenge on its own . By carrying out joint 
needs assessment s and planning, joint  purchases  and greater  coordination, we will ensure  that 
the phasing out of our dependency on  Russian fossil fuel s is both achievable and affordable  for 
all Member States . Legislation on renewable and energy efficiency will help realise  ambitious 
targets. A  truly interconnected and resilient EU energy network  will provide  energy security 
for all . These actions  constitute our plan to repower the EU.

3 1. Energy savings  
 
Savings are the quickest and cheapest way to address the current energy crisis . Reducing energy 
consumption cuts households’ and companies’ high energy bills in the short and long term, and 
decreases imports of Russian fossil fuels . Reducing energy consumption through higher 
efficiency is a vital component of the clean energy transition  which increases the resilience of 
the EU econo my and shields its competitiveness against high fossil fuel prices.  
Saving energy will help our supplies go further in the critical months ahead, while investments 
are being rolled out. The accompanying EU Save Energy  Communication  presents a two -
pronged approach: strengthening structural  change with mid- to long -term energy efficiency 
measures  and achieving immediate  energy savings through behaviour al change s. 
Fit for 55 would lower our gas consumption by 30% by 2030, with more than a third of such 
savings coming from meeting the EU energy efficiency target. Updated modelling assesses  the 
impact of the phase out of Russian fossil fuel dependence5 in terms of  higher energy prices and 
lower use of natural  gas. A further reduction of energy consumption compared to the previous 
Energy Efficiency Directive proposal6 and higher renewable energy targets would enable  the 
EU to fully meet the REPowerEU objectives, with other parts  of the Fit for 55 package 
unchanged.  
 The Commission therefore proposes to  increase to 13% the binding target in the Energy 
Efficiency Directive.  
In addition, the Commission invites the Parliament and Council to enable additional savings 
and energy efficiency gains in buildings through the Energy Performance of Buildings 
Directive , and to  uphold  the ambition of the Commission proposal for a Regulation on 
Ecodesign for Sustainable Products7, the rapid deployment of which will lead to further energy 
savings through improved  energy and resource  efficiency of a broad range of products.   
Pending agreement on the legislative measures, immediate energy savings can be made by 
changing our behaviour . The European Commission has launched, in cooperation with the 
International Energy Agency  (IEA) , a nine-point plan “Playing my part” for reducing energy 
use in the EU.  Based on input from stakeholders , the IEA estimate s that these types of short -
term energy saving  measures coul d achieve a 5% reduction in the demand for gas (around 13 
bcm) and in that for oil  (around 16 mtoe ).  
Member States should also make full use of supporting measures  such as  reduced VAT rates 
for high efficiency heating systems and for insulation in buildings and other energy pricing 
measures, which encourage switching to  heat pumps and purchase of more efficient appliances.  
Such measures should cushion social and distributional impacts, e.g. focusing on vulnerable 
households struggling to pay their energy bills and to manage the potential impact of the 
accelerated energy transition on the labour market, with immediate upskilling and reskilling 
needs.

4 Stepped up implementation and ambitious updating of National Energy and Climate Plans 
(NECPs) are key in delivering the REPowerEU  objectives . NECPs have a crucial role in 
enhancing investor confidence and investment predictability. They provide a good framework 
for planning and encouraging the reduction of use of fossil fuels.  
 The Commission intends to publish guidance later this year for the Member States’ 
update of their NECPs in 2024 and will report progress on REPowerEU, among others, 
through the State of the Energy Union and Climate Action reports.  
Regions and cities are playing  a leading role in developing energy saving  measures tailored  to 
their local context. They should launch awareness and information and support schemes, 
energy audits and energy management plans, pledging savings targets, and ensure citizens’ 
engagement such as  through the European Mission on climate -neutral and smart citie s or the 
European Urban Initiative  under cohesion policy .  
2. Diversify ing energy imports  
 
The EU has been working intensively with international partners for several months to diversify 
supplies8 and mitigate the rise in energy prices .  
Following the mandate  by the European Council  in March , the Commission and Member States 
have set  up an  EU Energy Platform for the voluntary common  purchase of gas, LNG and 
hydrogen.  On 5 May, the Commission and Bulgaria set up a first regional taskforce, as part of 
the EU's Energy Purchase Platform, in coordination with neighbours in  the south e ast of 
Europe.  
The EU Energy Platform  will fulfil three functions supporting common purchase of gas:  
 Demand aggregation and structuring : The demand pool will identify and aggregate 
contestable volumes based on expiring long -term contracts a s well as flexible volumes 
under existing long -term ga s contracts which could lead to roughly 30 -70 bcm of 
demand in the short term. In addition, the Commission will  encourage diversif ication 
of su pply and wil l consider legislative measures to require such diversification over 
time. Demand pooling will be supported by electronic  tools, which will  make the 
process secure, automated and user friendly.   
 Optimised and transparent use of the import, storage and transmission gas infrastructure 
maximising security  of supply and replenishment of storage.  
A mechanism and an IT tool will be put in place to improve the transpar ency in 
infrastructure bookings i.e. remaining availability, secondary markets, r erouting and 
existing bottlenecks. The exchange of information will be in line with antitrust rules.  
 International outreach : Joined up international outreach will focus on concluding long -
term cooperation frameworks with trusted partners via binding or non -binding 
agreements that support the purchasing of gas and hydrogen and clean energy project 
development, while fully using the collective strength of the Union.  
As a next step , the Commission will consider develop ing a voluntary operational ‘joint 
purchasing mechanism’ responsible for negotiati ng and contracting on behalf of participating 
Member States of the aggregated gas demand  and competitive release  to the market . Such 
                                                           
8  EU-US_LNG_2022_2.pdf (europa.eu)   
5 mechanism could take the form of  a Joint Venture or a business -owned entity,  leveraging the 
power of the European  market. Such a construct will be subject to review of its impact on 
competition.  
The Platform will also  work through  Regional Task Forces, which will identify needs and  
diversification  of supply options and coor dinate on contractual issues9. The Platform will set 
up a dedicated work stream with Member States on joint purchasing of hydrogen10. 
Industry expertise on the global energy market will be  important for the  success of the Platform. 
An Advisory Group will inform the Platform on issues such as  LNG  trade , financing, hedging 
and other elements along the value chain. The exchange of information will have to be 
compliant with antitrust rules.  
In line with t he conclusions of the European Council the EU Energy Platform is open for the 
Energy Community Contracting Parties (Western Balkans, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia). The 
Platform  should also benefit EU’s partners in its close neighbourhood, partners who are 
committed to the EU’s internal market rules and joint security of supply. The Platform will 
work closely with the Energy Community Secretariat to assist the Contracting Parties to make 
the most of the Platform.  
The emergency synchronisation of the electricity  grids of Ukraine and Moldova with Europe’s 
grid mid -March show s the commitment to ensure Ukraine ’s and Moldova ’s interconnect ion 
with the EU’s power grid . As soon as  the necessary technical improvements are completed, it 
will allow Member States in the re gion to purchase excess electricity from Ukraine, thus 
compensating for some of the reduced gas imports .  
With a full implementation of  the REPowerEU  plan, high prices, gas alternatives (sustainable 
biomethane, renewable hydrogen), further deployment of re newables, and structural demand 
measures such as energy efficiency , EU gas demand is expected to decrease  at a faster rate than 
foreseen under Fit for 55 . The EU will provide its  international  partners with long -term 
perspectives for mutually beneficial cooperation  by integrat ing hydrogen and renewable energy 
development and trade, as well as cooperation on methane emission reduction strategies in the 
gas diversification efforts, a s described i n the External Energy  Engagement  Strategy11. 
Diversification options are also important for Member States currently dependent on Russia 
for nuclear fuel for their reactors serving either power generation12 or non -power uses13. This 
requires working within the  EU and with international partners to secure alternative sources of 
uranium and boosting the conversion, enrichment and fuel fabrication capacities available in 
Europe or in EU’s global partners.  In addition to diversifying external suppliers, continuing 
domestic natural gas production for Member States where this is possible can contribute to 
strengthen security of supply.  
                                                           
9  On 5 May, the Commission and Bulgaria set  up a first regional taskforce, as part of the EU's Energy Platform, in 
coordination with neighbours in the  South East  of Europe.  Further Regional Task Forces, covering Central Eastern 
Europe, North -West and the Baltics will be proposed soon. In this conte xt, it is important that the biggest energy markets 
of the  EU, with access to diversification  infrastructure  such as LNG terminals,  are active participants in 
the diversification and security of supply  efforts  of the Platform.  
10  This dedicated hydrogen pu rchasing work stream will operationalise the European Global Hydrogen Facility, drawing on 
the experience of H2Global and of the Euratom Supply Agency, to be established under the EU Energy Platform.

12  Five Member States (Bulgaria, Czechia, Finland, Hungary, Slovakia) currently have VVER reactors operated on their 
territory, all fully reliant at present on fuel supplied by a Russian provider.  
13  Medium Power Research Reactors  (MPRRs), which include reactors in Czechia, Hungary, Poland, are characterised by 
their original Soviet design and are still dependent for fuel on the monopoly Russian manufacturer.

3. Substituting fossil fuels and accelerating Europe’s clean energy  transition  
 
A massive speed -up and scale -up in renewable  energy  in power generation, industry, 
buildings and transport  will accelerate our phasing out of  Russian fossil fuels . It will also, 
over time , lower electricity prices and reduce fossil fuel imports .  
Boosting renewable energy   
 Based on its modelling of impacts and feasibility14, the Commission is proposing  to 
increase the target in the Renewable Energy Directive to 45% by 2030, up from 
40% in last year’s proposal . This would bring the  total renewable energy generation 
capacities to 1236 GW  by 2030 , in comparison to 1067 GW by 2030 envisaged under 
Fit for 55 for 2030.   
 Solar  photovoltaics (PV)  is one of the fastest technologies to roll out . That is why the 
Commission sets the REPowerEU target of over 3 20 GW of solar photovoltaic 
newly installed by 2025, over twice today’s level , and almost 600 GW by 2030 .  As 
part of the increased ambition for solar, the  Commission : 
 presents the EU solar strategy15 ; 
 introduc es the European Solar Rooftop Initiative  anchored around a legally binding 
EU solar rooftop obligation for certain categories of buildings .  
Wind energy, in particular o ffshore wind represents a significant future opportunity: resources 
are stable, abundant and public acceptance is higher.  Europe is the global leader in offshore 
wind. To further strengthen the EU wind  sector’s global competitiveness, and achieve the 
REPowerEU ambition with fast wind  energy deployment, supply chains need to be 
strengthened and permitting drastically accelerated.  
 
The European Union should aim at doubling the current deployment rate of individual heat 
pumps,  resulting in a cumulative 10 million units over the next 5 years. Member States can 
accelerate the deployment and integration of  large -scale heat pumps , geothermal  and solar 
thermal energy  in a cost -effective way by:  
 developing and modernising district heating systems which can replace fossil fuels in 
individual heating ; 
 clean communal heating, especially in densely populated areas and cities ;  
 exploiting industrial  heat whenever available .  
To strengthen the supply chains for solar, wind and heat pump technologies and make them 
more su stainable, the Commission will:  
 enhance the regulatory framework and ensure life -cycle sustainability, by tabling, in 
the first quarter of 2023,  ecodesign and energy labelling requirements for solar PVs, 
and by revis ing existing requirements for heat pumps.

7  support efforts from Member States to pool their public resources via potential 
Important Projects of Common European Intere st (IPCEI) focused on breakthrough 
technologies and innovation along the solar and wind energy  and heat pumps value 
chain s.  
To promote the development of electricity storage capacities, the Commission proposes to 
consider storage assets as being in the ov erriding public interest and facilitate permitting for 
their deployment.   
Accelerating h ydrogen  
Renewable h ydrogen will be key to replace natural gas , coal  and oil in hard -to-decarbonise 
industr ies and transport. REPowerEU  sets a target of 10 million tonnes of domestic renewable 
hydrogen production and 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen imports by 2030. The 
Commission:  
 calls upon the European Parliament and the Council to  align the sub -targets for 
renewable fuels of non-biological origin under the Renewable Energy Directive for 
industry and transport with the RE PowerEU ambition (75% for industry and 5% for 
transport)16 and to rapidly conclude the revision of the Hydrogen and Gas Market 
package ;  
 will top -up Horizon Eur ope investments  on the Hydrogen Joint Undertaking ( EUR 200 
million) to double the number of Hydrogen Valleys ;  
 publishes for public feedback two Delegated Acts on the definition and production 
of renewable  hydrogen ;  
 intends to  complete the assessment of the first Important Projects of Common European 
Interest on hydrogen  by the summer;  
 calls on industry  to accelerate the work on missing hydrogen standards , in particular 
for hydrogen production, infrastructure and end -use appliances ;  
 will regularly report , in close cooperation with the Member States, starting in 2025,  on 
hydrogen uptake , and the use of renewable hydrogen in hard -to-abate appliances in 
industry and transport.  
Accelerated efforts are  needed to deploy hydrogen infrastructure  for produc ing, import ing 
and transport ing 20 million tonnes of hydrogen by 2030 . Cross-border hydrogen  infrastructure  
is still in its infancy , but the basis for planning and development has already been set by the 
inclusion of hydrogen infrastructure in the revised trans -European networks for energy . Total 
investment needs for key hydrogen infrastructure categories are estimated to be in the range of  
EUR 28 – 38 billion  for EU -internal pipelines and 6 - 11 billion  for storage.  
To facilitate the import of up to 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen , the Commission 
will support the development of three major hydrogen import corridors via the Mediterranean , 
the North Sea area and , as soon as conditions allow , with Ukraine. Green Hydrogen 
Partnerships will facilitate the imports of green hydrogen while supporting the decarbonisation

Accelerator and Achieving the Bio-methane Targets, accompanying this communication .  
8 in the partner countries . Other forms of fossil -free hydrogen, notably nuclear -based, also play 
a role in substituting natural gas  (see map) . 
To help achieve these targets, the Commission will : 
 map preliminary  hydrogen infrastructure need s by March 2023 , based on the TEN -E 
Regulation, in a process involving Member States, national regulatory authorities , 
ACER, ENTSOG, project promoters and other stakeholder ; 
 mobilise EU funding under CEF, Cohesion Policy and RRF ; 
 set up a dedicated work stream on joint renewable hydrogen purchasing under the EU 
Energy Platform . 
Scaling up b iomethane  
Boosting  sustainable  biomethane  production to 35  bcm by 2030  is a cost -efficient path to 
achieve  our ambition to reduce imports of natural gas from Russia. To increase the capacity of 
biogas production in the EU and promote its conversion into biomethane, the estimated 
investment needs amount to EUR 37 billon euro  over the period .    
 
As outlined in the  Biomethane Action Plan in the  accompanying staff working d ocument, t he 
Commission proposes to address  the main barriers to increased  sustainable  biomethane 
production and use and facilitation of its integration into the EU internal gas market by : 
 
 establishing an industrial biogas and bio -methane partnership to stimulate the 
renewable gases value chain ; 
 taking additional measures to encourage biogas producers to create energy 
communities;  
 providing incentives for biogas upgrading into bio -methane;  
 promot ing the adaptation and adjustment of existing and the deployment of new 
infrastructure for the transport of more  bio-methane through the EU gas grid;  
 address ing gaps in research, development and innovation;  
 facilitating access to finance , and m obilise EU funding under CEF, Cohesion Policy , 
RRF and  the Common Agricultural Policy . 
 
The focus should be on sustainable production, ensuring that biomethane is produced from 
organic waste and forest and agricultural residues, to avoid impacts on land use and food 
security.  
Bioenergy  makes up 60% of the renewable energy in the EU . It is a domestically available and 
stable energy source  but sustainable sourcing is key . Current e stimates show a moderate but 
steady increase of biomass use until 2030 . Prioritizing use of non -recyclable biomass waste 
and agricultural and forest residues will ens ure a sustainable energy production  that can 
contribute to the REPowerEU objectives .  
Reduc ing fossil consumption in  hard -to-abate  industr ial and transport  sectors  
Replacing coal, oil and natural gas in industrial processes will not only reduce carbon 
emissions , it will also strengthen industrial competitiveness  by shielding industrial production 
from volatile fossil fuel markets and support international technology leadership .   
9 Energy efficiency, fuel substitution, electrification, and an enhanced uptake of renewable 
hydrogen , biogas  and biomethane by industry could save up to 35 bcm of natural gas by 2030  
on top of what is foreseen under the Fit for 55 proposals . Production of non -metallic minerals, 
cement, glass and ceramics, production of chemica ls and refineries provide the biggest 
opportunities for reducing fossil gas demand – almost 22 bcm.   
There is also great  potential for electrification of industry . Current technologies already enable  
industrial companies to reduce their reliance on fossil  fuels. Opportunities to adopt electric 
technology will continue to expand as technologies improve  and renewables are rolled out .  
To support hydrogen uptake and electrification in industrial sectors, the Commission:  
 will roll out carbon contracts for difference and dedicated REPowerEU windows under 
the Innovation Fund to support a full switch of the existing  hydrogen production in 
industrial processes from natural gas to renewables  and the transition to hydrogen -based  
production processes in new industrial sectors, such as steel production17; 
 publishe s guidance to Member States on renewable energy and power purchase 
agreements18 (PPAs);  
 will, in cooperation with the EIB , develop a technical advisory facility under the 
InvestEU Advisory Hub to support PPA -financed renewable energy projects. To unlock  
industrial  investment , the Commission will double the funding available for the 2022 
Large Scale Call of the Innovation Fund this autumn to  around  EUR 3 billion . A 
specific REPowerEU window  will support (1) innovative electrification and hydrogen 
applications in industry, (2) innovative clean tech manufacturing (such as electrolysers 
and fuel cells, innovative renewable equipment, energy storage or heat pumps for 
industrial uses), and (3) mid -sized pilot projects for validating, testing and optimising 
highly innovative solutions .  
In transport, e lectrification  can be  combined with of the use of  fossil -free hydrogen to replace 
fossil fuels. To enhance energy savings and efficiencies in the transport sector  and accelerate 
the transition towards zero -emission vehicles,  the Commission:  
 will consider a legislative initiative to increase the  share of zero emission vehicles in 
public and corporate car fleets  above a certain  size; 
 calls on the co -legislators to swiftly adopt the pending proposals on alternative fuels 
and other transport related files supporting green mobility ; 
 will adopt in 2023 a legislative package on greening freight transport;  
Delivering RE PowerEU – with skilled people, raw materials and a complete regulatory 
framework   
Achieving  the REPowerEU  goals  will require diversifying the supply of renewable energy 
equipment  and of critical raw materials , reduc ing sectoral dependencies, overcoming supply 
                                                           
17  Based on REPowerEU , the Commission expects that around 30% of EU  primary  steel production will be decarbonized 
with renewable hydrogen by 2030, [requiring 1. 4 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen and investments of EUR [ 18-20] 
bn to replace blast furnaces with direct reduced iron (DRI) processes fueled by renewable  hydrogen .]

10 chain bottlenecks and expanding the EU’s clean energy technology manufacturing capacity. 
While t he EU is a global leader in electrolyser, wind and heat pump technologies, the EU solar 
panels and heat pumps market has seen increasing imports from Asi a over the last years .  
For heat pumps, a doubling of the deployment rate should be matched by a fast ramp up of the 
production of the necessary equipment, including, where necessary through facilitated access 
to finance.   
Beyond ensuring suppliers diversification, strengthening circular econom y models must be a 
priority. Support for research and innovation, including through Horizon Europe, will be 
provided  to reduce materials consumption, enhance recyclability of renewable energy 
equipment and subs titute critical raw materials.  
To enhance  industry’s contribution to REPowerEU  and reinforce its competitiveness , the 
Commission:  
 will set  up an EU Solar Industry Alliance ;  
 will work with  industry to scale up electrolyser manufacturing capacities, as laid out in 
the Electrolyser Declaration19; 
 will intensify work on the supply of critical raw materials  and prepare a legislative 
proposal.  The Commission will step up ongoing EU policies and actions (e.g. 
implementation and negotiation of Free Trade Agreements, cooperation with like -
minded partners, etc.)  and reinforce the EU’s monitoring capacity and help secure the 
supply of diverse critic al raw materials . This initiative will aim to strengthen the 
European value chain through the identification of mineral resources and of  critical  raw 
materials projects in the European strategic interest, while ensuring a high level of 
environmental protec tion, including projects that promote a circular economy and 
resource efficiency  
Accelerat ing and amplifying the deployment of renewables  and increasing energy efficiency  
relies on  a skilled workforce  and strong supply chains to meet  the increased demand for clean 
technology  and roll-out in the construction sector.  The clean energy transition offers ample  job 
market opportunities and helps ensure reskilled jobs for transition sectors.  
To address the skills shortages , the Commission : 
 encourages stakeholders in renewable energy production (solar, wind, geothermal, 
biomass, heat pumps etc.) and permitting authorities to establish a large -scale skills 
partnership  under the Pact for Skills20; 
 will support skills through  ERASMUS + and the Jo int Undertaking on Clean Hydrogen, 
with the launch of  a large project to develop skills for the hydrogen  economy.    
Speeding up  permitting and innovation  
                                                           
19  Electrolyser Summit Joint Declaration . Electrolyser manufactur ers in Europe committed to a tenfold increase of their 
capacity to manufacture electrolysers to 17.5 GW by 2025.  
20  The Pact for Skills supports large -scale skills partnerships in different industrial ecosystems, including Energy Intensive 
Industries, Construction and Renewable Energy. The Pact gathers and inspires commitments from individual companies, 
training providers and social partners to upskill or reskill people of working age, such as developing skilled professionals 
and the reskilling of gas b oiler installers in new technologies such as heat pumps, solar panels, etc.      
11 Slow and complex permitting processes are a key obstacle  to unleashing the renewables 
revolution  and for the competitiveness of the renewable energy industry . Obtaining a permit 
can take up to 9 years for wind projects, and up to 4 .5 years for ground -mounted solar projects. 
Varying permitting times between Member States demonstrate that national rule s and 
administrative capacities complicate and slow down permitting.  
 To help Member States exploit all possibilities for acceleration that exist within the 
legislative framework , the Commission presents a Recommendation on 
permitting21.  
It proposes  measures to streamline procedures at national level, addres ses ambiguities  in the 
application of EU legislation  and set s out good practices in Member States. It recommends 
participatory approaches that involv e local and regional authorities  and providing authorities 
with the necessary resources so as to  facilitate the timely realisation of locally adapted 
investments.  
 To kick-start the implementation of the Recommendation , the Commission will  
conven e renewable energy experts with environmental assessment experts from 
Member States on 13 June .  
High Level Summits hosted by Member States , such as the North Sea Summit in Denmark, 
will enhance  the case for investment in cross -border wind parks  and renewable projects.  
Member States should as a matter of priority implement  the permitting -related  Country 
Specific Recommendations  in the European Semester  and already adopted Recovery and 
Resilience Plans.  Equally , the full and rapid transposition by all Member States of the  
Renewable Energy Directive22 is a matter of urgency  to simplify  permitting procedures.  
 In order to support an acceleration of permitting procedures for renewable energy 
projects and related infrastructure,  the Commission is amending its proposal on the 
Renewable Energy Directive23 and asks the European Parliament and Council to 
ensure a swift agreement as part of the Fit for 55 package .  
The revised  proposal operationalises the  principle  of renewable energy as an overriding 
public interest , introduces the designation  of ‘go-to’ areas24 and other ways to shorten and 
simplify permitting  while also minimising potential risks and negative impacts  on the 
environment . It also provides for the possibility to create regulatory sandboxes  to foster 
innovation in t he sector.   
The Commission also calls on the Member States to speed up the transposition of the Electricity 
Directive to effectively allow consumers to participate in energy markets (individually or via

4.  Smart investment   
 
The Commission ’s analysis  indicates that REPowerEU entail s additional  investment of 210 
billion euro between  now and 2027 , on top of  what is needed to realise the objectives of the Fit 
for 55 proposals. Such investment will pay off. Implementation of  the Fit for 55 framework 
and the REPowerEU plan  will save  the EU EUR 80 b illion  in gas import expenditures, EUR 
12 bn in oil import expenditures and EUR 1.7 bn in coal import expenditures per year  by 
2030 .  
During the transition , the fast decoupling from Russian energy imports  can lead to higher and 
more volatile energy prices . Targeted measures are needed to m inimiz e volatility, keep prices 
in check  and protect the individuals in or at risk o f (energy) poverty  in order to ensure a fair 
transition  for all25. The Commission calls upon the European Parliament and the Council to 
adopt its proposal for a Social Climate Fund to support vulnerable households and  small 
business in the transition.  
4.1 European interconnection and i nfrastructure needs  
The REPowerEU plan brings  a significant  change to the energy system in terms of 
quantities and directions of energy flows . This is the time to implement many long pending 
projects , with a particular focus on cross -border connections to build an integrated energy 
market that secures supply in a spirit of solidarity .  
The Trans -European energy networks (TEN -E) framework  has helped establish a more 
resilient European gas infrastructure based that enables  more diversified supplies. Once the 
ongoing Projects  of common interest and Projects of mutual interests are implemented, all 
Member States and Neighbouring countries will hav e access to at least three gas sources or  to 
the global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market. In 2022 alone, gas PCIs with a total additional 
gas transmission capacity of 20 bcm/year have been or will be commissioned26. Very recently, 
a number of key projects  co-financed by the EU were completed or launched , such as the Gas 
Interconnector Poland -Lithuania (GIPL)27 of key importance to the Baltic region and a new 
                                                           
25  See for example the proposal for a Council Recommendation on ensuring a fair transition towards climate neutrality 
(COM(2021) 801 final ).  
26  In 2022 alone, PCIs with a total additional gas transmission capacity of 20 bcm/year have been or will be commissioned, 
e.g. the gas interconnector between Poland and Lithuania (the GIPL pipe line), the Poland -Slovakia interconnector, the 
Baltic Pipe between Poland and Denmark, the Greece -Bulgaria pipeline (IGB). LNG terminals in Cyprus (2 bcm/year) 
and Alexandroupolis Greece (5 bcm/year) are due to be operational in 2023. Moreover, several gas  PCIs are expected to 
be completed in the coming years which include several storage projects in South Eastern Europe (Greece, Romania, 
Bulgaria) as well the LNG Gdansk in Poland (at least 6 bcm/year). Besides, the support of the expansion of the Southern 
Gas Corridor to 20 bcm per year will play a major role to secure gas supply for South Eastern Europe (Greece and Italy 
at the beginning) and the Western Balkans.   
27  Opened on 5 May, GIPL is a major EU project developed under the Baltic Energy Market Inter connection Plan (BEMIP). 
The 508 -km-long pipeline connected Estonia, Finland, Latvia, and Lithuania to the gas market of the EU. Of some EUR 
500 million spent on the project, the EU contributed ca.  EUR 300  million.   
13 liquefied natural gas terminal in Northern Greece that will help Europe and the Balkans become 
less reliant on Russian supplies28 .  
The maps and project lists shown here are the result of analysis by the regional groups of the 
additional needs strictly linked to REPowerEU. They complement the existing list of projects  
of common interest , some of which, s uch as the Iberian interconnector s and connections for 
island Member States , have been under preparation for many years . These projects should now 
also be accelerated to complete the European infrastructure . The gas projects to be included in 
the REPowerEU  chapters of the Recovery and Resilience Plans should build on the analysis of 
the needs currently represented on the maps below.  
The regional assessment of additional gas infrastructure needs for REPowerEU shows that it  
will be possible to fully compensate the equivalent of Russian gas imports by a combination of 
demand reduction, a ramp up of domestic production of biogas /biomethane  and hydrogen, and 
limited additions of gas infrastructure. The most important needs are linked to meet demand in 
Central and Eastern Europe29, and in the northern part of Germany30, as well as the 
reinforcement of the Southern gas corridor . This limited a dditional infrastructure , as described 
in annex 3, should solve the needs for the forthcomi ng decade , without leading to a lock -in of 
fossil fuels and stranded assets that inhibit the long -term transition to a climate -neutral 
economy.  
Storage is  key for enhancing the security of supply. Appropriate support, including financial, 
should be provided to those projects that aim at increasing the storage and withdrawal 
capacities in order to ensure an increased level of preparedness and response to risks in the 
security of  gas supply.  To import sufficient LNG and pipeline gas from other suppliers, 
investments estimated at  EUR  10bn by 2030  will be required  for a sufficient level of gas 
infrastructure, including LNG import terminals, pipelines, to connect underutilised LNG 
import terminals and the EU network , and reverse flow capacities . Additional investments to 
connect LNG import terminals in the Iberian Peninsula and the EU network through hydrogen -
ready infrastructure may further contribute to diversify gas supply in the internal market and 
help tap into the long -term potential for renewable hydrogen. Also, a very limited investment 
will be needed to ensu re security of supply in Member States almost fully dependant on 
pipeline oil from Russia.  
Dependence on Russian fossil fuels also extends to crude oil and petroleum  products. While 
for the majority of cases the world market allows for quick effective repl acemen t, some 
Member States are more reliant on Russian pipe oil. The stop of supply from 
the Druzhba  pipeline,  which delivers crude oil to Europe directly from central Russia,  will 
increase pressure on alternative supply routes, namely ports (such as Gdansk,  Rostock, 
Trieste  or Omisalj) and alternative pipeline infrastructure, currently not prepared to handle 
such additional pressure, that serves the same regions.  
                                                           
28  The LNG facility in Alexandropoulis (a  floating storage and regasification unit) is set to be completed in the end of 2023 
and will have a capacity of 153,500 cubic metres, with a yearly potential throughput of 5.5 billion; the budget is ca EUR 
364 mn with EUR 167 mn from the 2014 -2020 cohesio n policy.  
29  Of great importance for the security of supply in Central and Eastern Europe are two gas corridors: the Trans -Balkan 
Corridor (Turkey -Bulgaria -Romania) and the Vertical Corridor (Greece -Bulgaria interconnector, Romania -Bulgaria 
interconnector and BRUA) which will facilitate the supply of gas from third countries in the region.  
30  See indicative projects in Annex 3.   
14 In this context,  very limited and  targeted investments to ensure the security of oil is n eeded.  
Projects building on and expanding the  capacity of the  existing infrastructure and tackling 
existing bottlenecks  (namely in the Transalpine  (TAL),  Adria  or SPSE  oil pipelines)  are key to 
ensure viable alternatives to the  most  affected Member States.  The establishment of alternative 
supply routes must  also be accompanied by targeted investments in the reconfiguration and 
upgrading of  petroleum product refineries, as replacing Urals crude oil 
by alternative  oil grades  entails technological changes. The  total investment needs to ensure 
the security of oil supply is expected to amount to up to EUR  1.5 -2bn. 
 
An additional EUR 29 billion of additional investments are needed in the power grid  by 
2030 , to make it fit for increased use and production of electricity.  All relevant projects are 
already included in the 5th PCI list31. The accelerated implementation of electricity PCIs is 
crucial for a n interconnected system with an  increase d share of renewable energy sources.  The 
current high electricity prices in  the Iberian Peninsula highlight the importance of  improving 
cross -border electricity interconnections  as a cost-effective way to ensure secure and affordable 
electricity supplies.  The Commission will continue to support and encourage the Spanish and 
French authorities for accelerating the  implementation  of the three existing projects of common 
interest  through the High Level Group South West Europe aiming at increasing the 
interconnection capacity between the Iberian Peninsula and France . The EU has already taken 
action for the synchronisation of the Baltic States' electricity networks with the continental 
European network. Once completed, no later than 2025, neither the electricity trade nor system 
operation can be used to threaten the energy  security of the region.    
Energy storage plays a significant role in ensuring flexibility and security of supply in the 
energy system by facilitating the integration of renewable generation, supporting the grid, and 
shifting energy to the time when it is most needed. Ultimately, energy storage reduces the use 
of gas power plants in the energy system.  
The Commission will also encourage the swift development of crucial offshore grids and cross -
border hydrogen infrastructure.

4.2 National reforms and inv estments  
While  most of the targets and objectives are European and require a strong coordination, 
implementation of many of the measures remain with Member States and require targeted 
reforms and investments .  
The Recovery and Resilience Plans (RRPs) have proven highly s uitable to implement urgent 
priorities in a joint EU framework , based on needs by Member States and with a strong results 
orientation.  They are already providing a set of ambitious reforms and investments to deliver 
on the twin transition. Their milestones and targets are more valid than ever.  
The Commission  invites Member States to add to their existing RRPs a dedicated chapter with 
new actions to deliver on the REPowerEU objectives of diversify ing energy supplies and 
reduc ing dependence o n fossil fuels . Technical support to Member States is available under the 
Technical Support Instrument32 for that purpose . Cross -border investments are  essential to 
strengthen interconnection and ensure the security of energy of supply for the Single Market. 
When assessing the dedicated RepowerEU chapters, the Commission will take its contribution 
towards the security of supply for the Union as a whole i nto account . The 2022 country -
specific recommendations  will guide  the new RRP chapters . The Commission issued together 
with this communication tailored recommendations for all Member States on energy policy in 
line with the REPowerEU objectives.    
The RRPs  should  ensure complementarity between measures funded under the R RF and 
actions supported via other national or EU funds. In particular, synergies must be increased 
                                                           
32  Technical Support Instrument: 2022 country factsheets | European Commission (europa.eu)   
 
17 between cohesion policy, in particular the European Regional Development Fund ( ERDF ), the 
European Social Fund+ (ESF+),  the second pillar of the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP), 
Connecting Europe Facility ( CEF) and the REPowerEU chapters  in the RRPs . For example for 
gas, mature projects f or grids, storage or LNG located in one Member State but having 
European importance can be included in the RRF REPowerEU chapter. RRPs could also for 
example support energy infrastructure projects selected in TEN -E regional groups for their 
common interest b ecause they link Member States' energy networks, connect regions currently 
isolated from European energy markets, strengthen existing cross -border interconnections, 
help integrate renewable energy, and respond to market integration, competitiveness and 
security of supply objectives. This allows freeing CEF energy funds for interconnectors in 
electricity, off -shore, hydrogen and other infrastructure projects of common interest that 
require cross -border planning and regional cooperation for their imp lementati on as provided 
under th e TEN -E policy.  
The RRPs provide for a fast and effective way to frontload investments focused on 
REPowerEU needs, combined with accompanying  reforms to maximise their impact.  As the 
REPowerEU chapter and cohesion policy funds both support the green energy transition , in 
energy efficiency and renewable energy investments  can be supported under both. In view of 
enhancing synergies between these policies, Member States have the possibility to plan their 
investments over the lifetime o f the programming period in a coordinated manner, taking into 
account the available funding and implementation timelines.   
4.3 Financing  
To mobilise finance for covering the short term REPowerEU  investment needs, t he 
Commission proposes a targeted and swift amendment of the Recovery and Facility 
Regulation. The amendment foresees allocating additional funding from the auctioning of 
allowances of the Emissions Trading System (‘ETS’ ), in a limited amount . It also proposes that 
Member States  benefit from a higher flexibility to transfer resources allocated to them both 
under the Common Provisions Regulation (EU) 2021/1060) and the Regulation on CAP 
strategic plans (EU) 2021/2115).  These grants will complement the remaining EUR 225 billion 
of loans under the RRF , resulting in a total amount close  to EUR 300 billion. It is proposed 
that if part of the remaining EUR 225 billion of loans under the RRF is not requested by the 
member States currently entitled to them within 30 days after the entry into force of the 
amended RRF Regulation,  these resources will be made available to other MS . 
Member States will have the possibility to transfer up to 12.5% of their allocation under the 
cohesion policy to the RRF  by adding a 7.5% transfer possibility for REPowerEU objectives 
based on demonstrable needs and provided that Member States have used the already available 
5% transfer possibility . This new transfer possibility will allow Member States to include in 
their RRPs  new investm ents and reforms  for that contribute to a rapid reduction of fossil fuel  
imports  from Russia. Such a transfer possibility is justified by  the urgent timeline and nature 
of some the investments needed . 
In addition , Member States will have the possibility to transfer up to 12.5% of their allocation 
under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development to the Recovery and Resilience 
Facility. Delivering part of the Common Agricultural Policy  financing under the R ecovery and 
Resilience Facility speed up  implementation of relevant projects, allowing farmers to receive  
18 the necessary financial support to reduce the use of synthetic  fertilizers and increase the 
production of sustainable biomethane or renewable energy.  
The process for undertaking voluntary transfers by Member States of cohesion poli cy funds 
and CAP funds to the RE PowerEU chapters of the recovery and resilience plans has been 
designed to ensure a swift adoption process, and should not delay the adoption and 
implementation of the strategic plans and programmes.  
Above all, it is important that Member States engage in a wide consultation process during the 
preparation of their REPowerEU chapters, in particular with local and regional authorities , 
social partners  as well as stakeholders from the agricultural sector, to ensure broad ownership 
that will be key for the successful implementation of the measures.  
Cohesion policy  funds with their strong record of supporting energy -related investments will 
contin ue to complement and strengthen the REPowerEU and European Green Deal objectives . 
Under the current MFF, cohesion policy will support decarbonisation and green transition 
projects with up to EUR 100 billion. To ensure swift disbursement, the Commission will put 
forward a flexible instrument to help member States mobilise private resources and  intends to 
adopt by the end of 2022 a delegated act to speed up the design and reimbursements  of energy 
efficiency projects and renewables projects through standard reimbursement schemes in 
cohesion policy. The Commission will also work with Member States in promoting the 
development of regional and local energy agencies as single entry point for energy projects.  
State aid rules  fully apply to the reforms and investments included into the REPowerEU 
chapters. It is the responsibility of each Member State to ensure that such measures comply 
with the EU State aid rules and follow the applicable State aid procedures. In light of the 
unpreceden ted urgency to reduce dependence on Russian fossil fuels, the Commission will 
look into ways to facilitate State aid control for REPowerEU measures while limiting 
distortions to competition . In particular, the Commission will provide guidance on how 
measures can be designed in line with State aid rules and fast track decisions once it has 
complete information. The Commission will also assist Member States in designing measures 
which can be exempted from notification under the General Block Exempti on Regulation. 
Finally, it will keep the Temporary Crisis Framework for State aid under constant review to 
ensure that it is apt for enabling Member States to address the effects of the current geopolitical 
situation, including in the field of energy, and it will continue ensuring that the State aid 
framework is generally fit -for-purpose.  
The Connecting Europe Facility –Energy  (CEF -E) will support projects of common interest 
(PCIs) not implemented by the market or not implemented otherwise within the timeframe 
needed to deliver on the REPowerEU objectives. The Commission launches together with 
this communication a new CEF Energy call for proposals for Projects of Common 
Interest (PCIs)  with a total estimated budget of around EUR 800 million. Successful projects 
will be selected in the second half of 2022 to support the most urgent infrastructure projects 
needed for realising  the REPowerEU priorities . In early 2023 , the Commission will launch  
another CEF Energy call for proposal s for PCIs for projects to apply that may not be ready for 
this year’s call.   
Member States can consider taxation  measures to support REPowerEU objectives  so as to 
incentivis e energy savings  and reduce fossil fuels consumption . Member States are encouraged  
19 to consider a dditional tax measures such as reductions and exemptions from vehicle taxation 
for both the purchase and use of electric and hydrogen vehicles, tax deductions linked to energy 
savings and the phase -out of envi ronmentally harmful subsidies. The Commission’s  pending 
proposal for a revision of the Energy Tax ation  Directive (ETD) , contributes  to the objectives 
of REPowerEU by setting price signals to reduce consumption of fossil fuels and save energy  
and the Commission calls on Member States to swiftly reach an  agreement.  
The InvestEU Programme  will mobilize private finance to support a wide range of 
investments that contribute to achieving the REPowerEU’s policy goals, by sharing risks with 
implementing partners. The Commission will work closely and in a Team E urope approach 
with the EIB Group, other implementing partners of the InvestEU Programme  and EU Member 
States to accelerate lending, blending and advisory products for renewables, energy efficiency 
and electricity networks . 
To enable the Innovation Fund  to cover 100% of the relevant costs in the case of competitive 
bidding, the European Parliament and the Council should swiftly examine the proposed 
amendment to the ETS Directive for the Innovation Fund, after which the Commission will 
swiftly adopt the n ecessary amendment to the Delegated Act establishing the Innovation Fund.  
5. Reinforc ing preparedness  
  
Europe must be ready and prepared for a severe supply disruption.  While the risk for unserved 
gas demand for this summer will be limited, there could be a risk that , without further action 
in the coming months , storages will not be sufficiently filled for next winter.  
 
Together with  the swift adoption of the storage regulation in view of starting implementation 
of refilling storage levels this summer , the Commission calls on Member States  to: 
  pre-emptively implement the EU Save Energy Communication . The gas saved in 
the short term can be used notably to refill underground storage ahead of the next 
winter;  
  update their contingency plans,  taking into account the recommendations contained 
in the Commission’s preparedness review. The updated contingency plans should 
identify the essential customers which play a key role for critical supply chains in the 
Union;  
 ask transmission system operat ors to accelerate the technical measures, which can 
increase the reverse flow capacities from west to east by the next winter , including 
regarding the technical requirement concerning the composition of gas;   
 conclude the outstanding bilateral solidarity arrangements between neighbouring 
countries.  
The existing EU legal framework already foresees that i n case of extreme crisis Member States 
can request their neighbouring Member States solidarity measures.  Solidarity measures  are 
meant as last resort  in the event of an extreme gas shortage to ensure supply to households, 
district heating systems and basic social facilities in the affected country.    
20 The Commission will issue guidance on the prioritisation criteria of non -protected 
customers , in partic ular of industry. The guidance will focus, on the one hand, on the 
identification of national and cross -border value chains of key and critical importance which, 
if disrupted, could negatively impact on security, food, health and safety at European and glo bal 
level. It should also assess the impact on the competitiveness of the different territories . The 
Commission will  also facilitate setting up a  coordinated EU demand reduction plan  with pre -
emptive voluntary curtailment measures  which  should be ready for activation before an actual 
emergency arises . This plan would include voluntary market -based measures to reduce the 
consumption of undertakings  and thus  guarantee that supplies to protected customers are 
prioritised.  In addition, t he Commission is reviewing Member States’ Risk Preparedness Plans 
in the electricity sector to minimize the impact of potential gas disruptions on electricity 
generation.  
Conclusions   
The time t o reduce Europe’s strategic energy dependence  is now. REPowerEU accelerates 
diversification and more renewable gases, frontloads  energy savings and electrification with 
the potential to deliver as soon as possible  the equivalent of the fossil fuels  Europe currently 
imports f rom Russia  every year . It does this with coordinated planning, in the joint interest and 
with strong European solidarity.  
There is a double urgency to  reduce Europe’s energy dependence : the climate crisis , severely 
compounded by Russia’s aggression against Ukraine , and EU’s dependence on fossil fuels, 
which Russia uses as  an economic and political weapon.  
The green transformation of Europe’s energy system will strengthen economic growth, 
reinforce its industrial leadership, and put Europe on a path towards climate neutrality by 2050.  
The European Commission calls on leaders, Member States, regional and local authorities, and 
indeed every citizen and business, to  reduce Europe’s energy dependence from Russia through 
the implementation of this REPowerEU plan.

Storage key enhancing security supply. Appropriate support, financial, provided projects aim increasing storage withdrawal capacities order ensure increased level preparedness response risks security gas supply. To import sufficient LNG pipeline gas suppliers, investments estimated EUR 10bn 2030 required sufficient level gas infrastructure, LNG import terminals, pipelines, connect underutilised LNG import terminals EU network , reverse flow capacities . Additional investments connect LNG import terminals Iberian Peninsula EU network hydrogen - ready infrastructure may contribute diversify gas supply internal market help tap long -term potential renewable hydrogen. Also, limited investment needed ensu security supply Member States almost fully dependant pipeline oil Russia. Dependence Russian fossil fuels also extends crude oil petroleum products. While majority cases world market allows quick effective repl acemen t, Member States reliant Russian pipe oil. The stop supply Druzhba pipeline, delivers crude oil Europe directly central Russia, increase pressure alternative supply routes, namely ports (such Gdansk, Rostock, Trieste Omisalj) alternative pipeline infrastructure, currently prepared handle additional pressure, serves regions. 28 The LNG facility Alexandropoulis (a floating storage regasification unit) set completed end 2023 capacity 153,500 cubic metres, yearly potential throughput 5.5 billion; budget ca EUR 364 mn EUR 167 mn 2014 -2020 cohesio n policy. 29 Of great importance security supply Central Eastern Europe two gas corridors: Trans -Balkan Corridor (Turkey -Bulgaria -Romania) Vertical Corridor (Greece -Bulgaria interconnector, Romania -Bulgaria interconnector BRUA) facilitate supply gas third countries region. 30 See indicative projects Annex 3. 14 In context, limited targeted investments ensure security oil n eeded. Projects building expanding capacity existing infrastructure tackling existing bottlenecks (namely Transalpine (TAL), Adria SPSE oil pipelines) key ensure viable alternatives affected Member States. The establishment alternative supply routes must also accompanied targeted investments reconfiguration upgrading petroleum product refineries, replacing Urals crude oil alternative oil grades entails technological changes. The total investment needs ensure security oil supply expected amount EUR 1.5 -2bn.

When assessing dedicated RepowerEU chapters, Commission take contribution towards security supply Union whole nto account . The 2022 country - specific recommendations guide new RRP chapters . The Commission issued together communication tailored recommendations Member States energy policy line REPowerEU objectives. The RRPs ensure complementarity measures funded R RF actions supported via national EU funds. In particular, synergies must increased 32 Technical Support Instrument: 2022 country factsheets | European Commission (europa.eu) 17 cohesion policy, particular European Regional Development Fund ( ERDF ), European Social Fund+ (ESF+), second pillar Common Agriculture Policy (CAP), Connecting Europe Facility ( CEF) REPowerEU chapters RRPs . For example gas, mature projects f grids, storage LNG located one Member State European importance included RRF REPowerEU chapter. RRPs could also example support energy infrastructure projects selected TEN -E regional groups common interest b ecause link Member States' energy networks, connect regions currently isolated European energy markets, strengthen existing cross -border interconnections, help integrate renewable energy, respond market integration, competitiveness security supply objectives. This allows freeing CEF energy funds interconnectors electricity, -shore, hydrogen infrastructure projects common interest require cross -border planning regional cooperation imp lementati provided th TEN -E policy. The RRPs provide fast effective way frontload investments focused REPowerEU needs, combined accompanying reforms maximise impact. As REPowerEU chapter cohesion policy funds support green energy transition , energy efficiency renewable energy investments supported both. In view enhancing synergies policies, Member States possibility plan investments lifetime f programming period coordinated manner, taking account available funding implementation timelines. 4.3 Financing To mobilise finance covering short term REPowerEU investment needs, Commission proposes targeted swift amendment Recovery Facility Regulation. The amendment foresees allocating additional funding auctioning allowances Emissions Trading System (‘ETS’ ), limited amount . It also proposes Member States benefit higher flexibility transfer resources allocated Common Provisions Regulation (EU) 2021/1060) Regulation CAP strategic plans (EU) 2021/2115). These grants complement remaining EUR 225 billion loans RRF , resulting total amount close EUR 300 billion. It proposed part remaining EUR 225 billion loans RRF requested member States currently entitled within 30 days entry force amended RRF Regulation, resources made available MS . Member States possibility transfer 12.5% allocation cohesion policy RRF adding 7.5% transfer possibility REPowerEU objectives based demonstrable needs provided Member States used already available 5% transfer possibility . This new transfer possibility allow Member States include RRPs new investm ents reforms contribute rapid reduction fossil fuel imports Russia. Such transfer possibility justified urgent timeline nature investments needed . In addition , Member States possibility transfer 12.5% allocation European Agricultural Fund Rural Development Recovery Resilience Facility. Delivering part Common Agricultural Policy financing R ecovery Resilience Facility speed implementation relevant projects, allowing farmers receive 18 necessary financial support reduce use synthetic fertilizers increase production sustainable biomethane renewable energy. The process undertaking voluntary transfers Member States cohesion poli cy funds CAP funds RE PowerEU chapters recovery resilience plans designed ensure swift adoption process, delay adoption implementation strategic plans programmes. Above all, important Member States engage wide consultation process preparation REPowerEU chapters, particular local regional authorities , social partners well stakeholders agricultural sector, ensure broad ownership key successful implementation measures. Cohesion policy funds strong record supporting energy -related investments contin ue complement strengthen REPowerEU European Green Deal objectives . Under current MFF, cohesion policy support decarbonisation green transition projects EUR 100 billion. To ensure swift disbursement, Commission put forward flexible instrument help member States mobilise private resources intends adopt end 2022 delegated act speed design reimbursements energy efficiency projects renewables projects standard reimbursement schemes cohesion policy. The Commission also work Member States promoting development regional local energy agencies single entry point energy projects. State aid rules fully apply reforms investments included REPowerEU chapters. It responsibility Member State ensure measures comply EU State aid rules follow applicable State aid procedures. In light unpreceden ted urgency reduce dependence Russian fossil fuels, Commission look ways facilitate State aid control REPowerEU measures limiting distortions competition . In particular, Commission provide guidance measures designed line State aid rules fast track decisions complete information. The Commission also assist Member States designing measures exempted notification General Block Exempti Regulation. Finally, keep Temporary Crisis Framework State aid constant review ensure apt enabling Member States address effects current geopolitical situation, field energy, continue ensuring State aid framework generally fit -for-purpose. The Connecting Europe Facility –Energy (CEF -E) support projects common interest (PCIs) implemented market implemented otherwise within timeframe needed deliver REPowerEU objectives. The Commission launches together communication new CEF Energy call proposals Projects Common Interest (PCIs) total estimated budget around EUR 800 million. Successful projects selected second half 2022 support urgent infrastructure projects needed realising REPowerEU priorities . In early 2023 , Commission launch another CEF Energy call proposal PCIs projects apply may ready year’s call. Member States consider taxation measures support REPowerEU objectives incentivis energy savings reduce fossil fuels consumption . Member States encouraged 19 consider dditional tax measures reductions exemptions vehicle taxation purchase use electric hydrogen vehicles, tax deductions linked energy savings phase -out envi ronmentally harmful subsidies. The Commission’s pending proposal revision Energy Tax ation Directive (ETD) , contributes objectives REPowerEU setting price signals reduce consumption fossil fuels save energy Commission calls Member States swiftly reach agreement. The InvestEU Programme mobilize private finance support wide range investments contribute achieving REPowerEU’s policy goals, sharing risks implementing partners. The Commission work closely Team E urope approach EIB Group, implementing partners InvestEU Programme EU Member States accelerate lending, blending advisory products renewables, energy efficiency electricity networks . To enable Innovation Fund cover 100% relevant costs case competitive bidding, European Parliament Council swiftly examine proposed amendment ETS Directive Innovation Fund, Commission swiftly adopt n ecessary amendment Delegated Act establishing Innovation Fund. 5. Reinforc ing preparedness Europe must ready prepared severe supply disruption. While risk unserved gas demand summer limited, could risk , without action coming months , storages sufficiently filled next winter. Together swift adoption storage regulation view starting implementation refilling storage levels summer , Commission calls Member States to:  pre-emptively implement EU Save Energy Communication . The gas saved short term used notably refill underground storage ahead next winter;  update contingency plans, taking account recommendations contained Commission’s preparedness review. The updated contingency plans identify essential customers play key role critical supply chains Union;  ask transmission system operat ors accelerate technical measures, increase reverse flow capacities west east next winter , regarding technical requirement concerning composition gas;  conclude outstanding bilateral solidarity arrangements neighbouring countries. The existing EU legal framework already foresees n case extreme crisis Member States request neighbouring Member States solidarity measures. Solidarity measures meant last resort event extreme gas shortage ensure supply households, district heating systems basic social facilities affected country. 20 The Commission issue guidance prioritisation criteria non -protected customers , partic ular industry. The guidance focus, one hand, identification national cross -border value chains key critical importance which, disrupted, could negatively impact security, food, health safety European glo bal level. It also assess impact competitiveness different territories . The Commission also facilitate setting coordinated EU demand reduction plan pre - emptive voluntary curtailment measures ready activation actual emergency arises . This plan would include voluntary market -based measures reduce consumption undertakings thus guarantee supplies protected customers prioritised. In addition, Commission reviewing Member States’ Risk Preparedness Plans electricity sector minimize impact potential gas disruptions electricity generation. Conclusions The time reduce Europe’s strategic energy dependence now. REPowerEU accelerates diversification renewable gases, frontloads energy savings electrification potential deliver soon possible equivalent fossil fuels Europe currently imports f rom Russia every year . It coordinated planning, joint interest strong European solidarity. There double urgency reduce Europe’s energy dependence : climate crisis , severely compounded Russia’s aggression Ukraine , EU’s dependence fossil fuels, Russia uses economic political weapon. The green transformation Europe’s energy system strengthen economic growth, reinforce industrial leadership, put Europe path towards climate neutrality 2050. The European Commission calls leaders, Member States, regional local authorities, indeed every citizen business, reduce Europe’s energy dependence Russia implementation REPowerEU plan."

THE EUR OPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUR OPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 194(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draf t legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committe e (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),
Acting in accordance with the ordinar y legislative procedure (3),
Whereas:
(1) Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) has been substantially amended several 
times (5). Since further amendments are to be made, that Directive should be recast in the intere sts of clarity.
(2) Und er the Paris Agreement (6), adop ted in December 2015 under the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climat e Change (UNFCCC) (the ‘Paris Agreement’ ), its Parties have agreed to hold the increase in the global average 
temperature well below 2 oC above pre-industr ial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 
1,5 oC above pre-industr ial levels. Reac hing the objectives of the Paris Agreement is at the core of the Commission 
communication of 11 December 2019 entitled ‘The European Green Deal’ (the ‘European Green Deal’). The Union

belo w 1990 levels in the updated nationally determi ned contr ibution submitted to the UNFCCC Secretar iat on 
17 December 2020.
(3) As announced in the European Green Deal, the Commission present ed its Renova tion Wave strate gy in its 
communication of 14 Octob er 2020 entitled ‘A Renova tion Wave for Europe — greening our buildings, creating 
jobs, imp roving lives’. The Renovation Wave strategy contains an action plan with concrete regulator y, financing and 
enabling measures, with the objective to at least double the annual energy renova tion rate of buildings by 2030 and 
to foster deep reno vations, resulting in 35 million building units reno vated by 2030 and the creation of jobs in the

which contr ibut ed to social inclusion and the well-being of citizens, in particular worker communities. By facilitating 
training, networks and providing guidelines to archit ects, students, engineers and designers under the principles of

commitment of net greenhouse gas emissions (emissions after the deduction of removals) of at least 55 % belo w 
1990 levels by 2030.
(5) The ‘Fit for 55’ legislative pack age, announced by means of the Commission communication of 19 Octob er 2020 
entitled ‘Commission Work Programme 2021 — A Union of vitality in a world of fragility’, aims to implement those 
objectives. That packag e covers a rang e of policy areas including energy efficiency , renewable energy , land use, land 
change and forestr y, energy taxation, effort shar ing, emissions trading and alternative fuels infrastr ucture. The 
revision of Directive 2010/31/EU is an integral part of that packag e. Building on the ‘Fit for 55’ legislative pack age, 
the REP owerEU plan contained in the Commission communication of 18 May 2022 entitled ‘REP owerEU Plan’ put 
forward an additional set of actions to save energy , diversify supplies, quickly substitut e fossil fuels by accelerating 
Europe’s clean energy transition and smar tly combine invest ments and reforms. It contained new legislative 
proposals and targe ted recommendations by which to increase ambition with regard to energy efficiency and 
savings. The communication also referred to taxation measures as means to provide incentives for energy savings 
and reduce fossil fuel consump tion.
(6) Buildings account for 40 % of final energy consump tion in the Union and 36 % of its energy-related greenhouse gas 
emissions while 75 % of Union buildings are still energy-inefficient. Natural gas plays the largest role in the heating 
of buildings, accounting for around 39 % of energy consump tion used for space heating in the residential sector. Oil 
is the second most impor tant fossil fuel for heating, accounting for 11 % and coal accounts for around 3 %. 
Theref ore, reduction of energy consump tion, in line with the ‘energy efficiency first’ principle as laid down in 
Article 3 of Directive (EU) 2023/1791 of the European Parliame nt and of the Council (8) and defined in Article 2, 
point (18), of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9) and the use of energy 
from renewable sources in the buildings sector constitute imp ortant measures needed to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions and energy poverty in the Union. Reduced energy consump tion and an increased use of energy from 
renewable sources, especially solar energy , also have a key role to play in reducing the Union’s energy dependency on 
fossil fuels overall and on imports especially , promoting secur ity of energy supply in line with the objectives set out 
in the REP owerEU plan, foster ing technological developments and in creating oppor tunities for emplo yment and 
regional development, in particular in islands, rural areas and off-gr id communities.
(7) Buildings are responsible for greenhouse gas emissions before, during and after their operational lifetime. The 2050 
vision for a decarbonised building stock goes beyond the current focus on operational greenhouse gas emissions. 
The whole-life-cy cle emissions of buildings should theref ore progressively be take n into account, starting with new 
buildings. Buildings are a signifi cant material bank , being reposito ries for resources over many decades, and the 
design options and choices of materi als largely influence the whole-life-cy cle emissions both for new buildings and 
reno vations. The whole-life-cy cle perf ormance of buildings should be taken into account not only in new 
constr uction, but also in renovations through the inclusion of policies for the reduction of whole-lif e-cy cle 
greenhouse gas emissions in Member States’ national building renova tion plans.EN OJ L, 8.5.2024

achieving climate neutrality and amending Regulations (EC) No 401/2009 and (EU) 2018/1999 (‘European Climate Law’) (OJ L 243,

Regulation (EU) 2023/955 (OJ L 231, 20.9.2023, p. 1).
(9) Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the Governance of the Energy 
Union and Climate Action, amending Regulations (EC) No 663/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 of the European Parliament and of the

Parliament and of the Council, Council Directives 2009/119/EC and (EU) 2015/652 and repealing Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of 
the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 328, 21.12.2018, p. 1).(8) Minimising the whole-life-cy cle greenhouse gas emissions of buildings requires resource efficiency and circular ity. 
This can also be combined with turning parts of the building stoc k into a temporar y carbon sink.
(9) The global warming potent ial (GWP) over a building’s whole life cycle indicates the building’s overall contr ibution to 
emissions that lead to climat e chang e. It brings together greenhouse gas emissions embodied in constr uction 
products with direct and indirect emissions from the use stage. A requirement to calculate the life-cy cle GWP of new 
buildings theref ore constitute s a first step towards increased consideration of the whole-life-cy cle perfor mance of 
buildings and a circular economy .
(10) Buildings are responsible for about half of primar y fine particulat e matt er (PM2,5) emissions in the Union that cause 
premature death and illness. Imp roving the energy perfo rmance of buildings can and should reduce pollutant 
emissions at the same time, in accordance with Directive (EU) 2016/2284 of the European Parliament and of the 
Council (10).
(11) Measures to improve further the energy perf ormance of buildings should take into account climatic conditions, 
including adap tation to climat e change, local conditions as well as the indoor climate and cost-eff ectiveness. Those 
measures should not affect other requirements concer ning buildings such as accessibility , fire safety and seismic 
safety and the intende d use of the building.
(12) The energy perf ormance of buildings should be calculated on the basis of a methodology , which may be 
differentiated at national and regional level. That methodology should include, in addition to ther mal charact eristics, 
other factors that play an increasing ly important role such as urban heat island effect, heating and air-conditioning 
installations, the use of energy from renewable sources, building automat ion and control syste ms, heat recovery 
from exhaust air or wast e water , syste m balancing, smar t solutions, passive heating and cooling elements, shading, 
indoor environmental quality , adequat e natural light and design of the building. The methodology for calculating the 
energy perfo rmance of buildings should be based not only on the season in which heating or air-conditioning is 
required, but should cover the annual energy perfo rmance of a building. It should take into account existing 
European standards. The methodology should ensure the representation of actual operating conditions and enable 
the use of metered energy to verify correctness and for comparability , and should be based on monthly , hourly or 
sub-hourly calculation inter vals. In order to encourage the use of on-site renewable energy , and in addition to the 
common general framew ork, Member States should take the necessar y measures to the effect that the benefits of 
maximising the use of on-sit e renewable energy , including for other uses, such as electr ic vehicle recharging points, 
are recognised and accounted for in the calculation methodology .
(13) Member States should set minimum energy perfo rmance requirements for buildings and building elements with 
a view to achi eving the cost-optim al balance between the investments involved and the energy costs saved 
throughout the life cycle of the building, without prejudice to the right of Member States to set minimum energy 
perf ormance requirements which are more energy-eff icient than cost-optim al energy efficiency levels. Provi sion 
should be made for the possibility for Member States to review regularly their minimum energy perf ormance 
requirements for buildings in light of technical progress.
(14) Two thirds of the energy used for heating and cooling of buildings still comes from fossil fuels. In order to 
decarbonise the building sector , it is of particular imp ortance to phase out fossil fuel in heating and cooling. 
Theref ore, Member States should indicate their national policies and measures to phase out fossil fuels in heating and 
cooling in their national building renova tion plans. They should strive to phase out stand-alone boilers powere d by 
fossil fuels, and, as a first step, they should not provide, from 2025, financ ial incentives for the installation of 
stand-alone boilers powered by fossil fuels, with the exception of those selected for investment, before 2025, under 
the Recover y and Resilience Facility established by Regulation (EU) 2021/241 of the European Parliament and of the 
Council (11), and the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund under Regulation (EU) 
2021/1058 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12). It should still be possible to provid e financial 
incentives for the installation of hybrid heating systems with a considerable share of renewable energy , such as the OJ L, 8.5.2024 EN

emissions of certain atmospher ic pollutants, amending Directive 2003/35/EC and repealing Directive 2001/81/EC (OJ L 344,

(12) Regulation (EU) 2021/1058 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 June 2021 on the European Regional 
Development Fund and on the Cohesion Fund (OJ L 231, 30.6.2021, p. 60).combination of a boiler with solar ther mal or with a heat pump. A clear legal basis for the banning of heat 
generato rs on the basis of their greenhouse gas emissions, the type of fuel used or to the minimum part of renewable 
energy used for heating at building’s level should suppor t national phase-out policies and measures.
(15) Domestic hot-wat er generation is one of the main sources of energy consump tion for high-perfo rming buildings. In 
most cases, that energy is not recovered. Harvesting heat from domestic hot-water drains in buildings could be 
a simple and cost-eff ective way to save energy .
(16) Energy perf ormance requirements for technical building systems should apply to whole syste ms, as installed in 
buildings, and not to the perform ance of standalone comp onents, which fall under the scope of product-specif ic 
regulations under Directive 2009/125/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (13). When setting energy 
perf ormance requirements for technical building syste ms, Member States should use, where available and 
appropr iate, harmonised instr uments, in particular testing and calculation methods and energy efficiency classes 
developed under measures imp lementing Directive 2009/125/EC and Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 of the European 
Parliament and of the Council (14), with a view to ensur ing consistency with relate d initiatives and minimise, to the 
exte nt possible, potential fragmentation of the marke t. Energy-savi ng technologies with very shor t payback periods, 
such as the installation or replacement of ther mostatic control valves or heat recovery from exhaust air or waste 
water, are given insufficient consideration today. When estimating the effective rated output for heating systems, 
air-conditioning syste ms, syste ms for combined space heating and ventilation, or syste ms for combined 
air-conditioning and ventilation syste ms, in a given building or building unit the effective rated output of different 
generato rs of the same system should be added together .
(17) This Directive is without prejudice to Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union 
(TFEU). The term ‘incentive’ as used in this Directive should not theref ore be interpreted as constituting State aid.
(18) The Commission should lay down a comparative methodology framew ork for calculating cost-optim al levels of 
minimum energy perf ormance requirements. A review of that framew ork should enable the calculation of both 
energy and emission perform ance and should take into account environmental and health exte rnalities, as well as the 
exte nsion of the emission trading syste m and carbon prices. Member States should use that framew ork to compare 
the results with the minimum energy perf ormance requirements which they have adopt ed. Should there be 
significant discrepancies, namely discrepancies that exceed 15 %, between the calculated cost-optimal levels of 
minimum energy performance requirements and the minimum energy perf ormance requirements in force, Member 
States should justify the difference or plan appropr iate steps to reduce the discrepancy . The estimated economic life 
cycle of a building or building element should be determined by Member States, taking into account current 
practices and exper ience in defining typical economic life cycles. Member States should submit to the Commission, 
on a regular basis, the results of that compari son and the data used to reach those results. Those repor ts should 
enable the Commission to assess and repor t on the progress of Member States in reac hing cost-opt imal levels of 
minimum energy perform ance requirements.
(19) Major renovations of existing buildings, regard less of their size, provide an oppor tunity to take cost-eff ective 
measures to enhance energy perfo rmance. For reasons of cost-eff ectiveness, it should be possible to limit the 
minimum energy perfor mance requirements to the renovat ed parts that are most relevant for the energy 
perf ormance of the building. Member States should be able to define a ‘major renovation’ either in terms of 
a percentage of the surface of the building envelop e or in terms of the value of the building. If a Member State 
decides to define a major renova tion in terms of the value of the building, values such as the actuar ial value, or the 
current value based on the cost of reconstr uction, excluding the value of the land upon which the building is 
situat ed, could be used.
(20) The enhanced climate and energy ambition of the Union requires a new vision for buildings: the zero-emission 
building, with very low energy demand, zero on-site carbon emissions from fossil fuels and zero or a very low 
amount of operational greenhouse gas emissions. All new buildings should be zero-emission buildings by 2030, and 
existing buildings should be transf ormed into zero-emission buildings by 2050.EN OJ L, 8.5.2024
4/68 ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2024/1275/oj(13) Directive 2009/125/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 establishing a framew ork for the setting 
of ecodesign requirements for energy-relat ed products (OJ L 285, 31.10.2009, p. 10).
(14) Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2017 setting a framework for energy labelling 
and repealing Directive 2010/30/EU (OJ L 198, 28.7.2017, p. 1).(21) Where an existing building is altered, it is not considered to be a new building.
(22) Different options are available to cover the energy needs of a zero-emission building: energy generated on site or 
nearby from renewable sources such as solar ther mal, geother mal, solar phot ovoltaics, heat pumps, hydroelectr ic 
power and biomass, renewable energy provid ed by renewable energy communities, efficient distr ict heating and 
cooling, and energy from other carbon-free sources. Energy derived from combustion of renewable fuels is 
considered to be energy from renewable sources generated on-sit e where the combustion of the renewable fuel take s 
place on-sit e.
(23) Zero-emission buildings can contr ibut e to demand-side flexibility for instance through demand managem ent, 
electr ical storag e, ther mal storag e and distr ibut ed renewable generation to suppor t a more reliable, sustainable and 
efficient energy system.
(24) The necessar y decarbonisation of the Union building stock requires energy reno vation at a large scale: almost 75 % 
of that building stock is ineff icient according to current building standards, and 85 to 95 % of the buildings that exist 
today will still be standing in 2050. How ever , the weight ed annual energy reno vation rate is persistently low at 
around 1 %. At the current pace, the decarbonisation of the building secto r would require centur ies. Triggering and 
suppor ting building renova tion, including a shift towards emission-free heating systems, is theref ore a key goal of 
this Directive. Suppor ting renova tions at distr ict-level, including through industr ial or serial type renovations, offers 
benefits by stimulating the volume and depth of building renova tions and will lead to a quick er and cheaper 
decarbonisation of the building stoc k. Industr ial solutions for constr uction and building reno vation include versatile 
pref abricated elements providing diffe rent functions such as insulation and energy generation.
(25) Minimum energy perf ormance standards are the essential regulato ry tool by means of which to trigger the 
reno vation of existing buildings on a large scale, as they tackle the key barriers to renovation such as split incentives 
and co-ownership structures, which cannot be overcome by economic incentives. The introduction of minimum 
energy perfor mance standards should lead to a gradual phasing out of the worst-per forming buildings and 
a continuous improvement of the national building stoc k, contr ibuting to the long-t erm goal of a decarbonised 
building stock by 2050.
(26) Minimum energy perfo rmance standards for non-residential buildings should be provided for at Union level and 
should focus on the renovation of the worst-per forming non-residential buildings, which have the highest pote ntial 
in terms of decarbonisation and exte nded social and economic benef its and theref ore need to be renova ted as 
a priority. In addition, Member States should establish specific timelines for the further renova tion of non-residential 
buildings in their national building renova tion plans. Some specific situations justify exem ptions for individual 
non-residential buildings from minimum energy perf ormance standards, in particular the planned demolition of 
a building or an unfa vourable cost-benefi t assessment ; cases of serious hardship justify an exemp tion for as long as 
the hardship persists. Member States should establish stringent criteria for such exemp tions in order to avoid 
a dispropor tionate share of exem pted non-residential buildings. They should communicate those criteria in their 
national building renovati on plans and should comp ensate for the exemp ted non-residential buildings via equivalent 
energy perfo rmance improvements in other parts of the non-residential building stock.
(27) As regard s residential buildings, Member States should have the flexibility to choose the tools by means of which 
they achi eve the required imp rovement of the residential building stock, such as minimum energy perf ormance 
standards, technical assistance and financial suppor t measures. Member States should establish a national traject ory 
for the progressive renova tion of the national residential building stoc k in line with the national roadmap and the 
2030, 2040 and 2050 targe ts contained in the Member State’s national building renova tion plan and with the 
transf ormation of the national building stock into a zero-emission building stock by 2050. The national traje ctor ies 
should comp ly with interm ediat e, five-year milestones for the decrease in the averag e primar y energy use of the 
residential building stock, starting in 2030, which ensure similar efforts across Member States.
(28) As rega rds the rest of the national building stock, Member States are free to decide whether they wish to introduce 
minimum energy perf ormance standards, designed at national level and adap ted to national conditions. When 
reviewing this Directive, the Commission should assess whether the measures established pursuant to this Directive 
will deliver sufficient progress towards achieving a fully decarbonised, zero-emission building stock by 2050 or 
whether further measures, such as binding minimum energy perfor mance standards need to be introduced, in 
particular for residential buildings in order to achieve the five-year milest ones.OJ L, 8.5.2024 EN
ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2024/1275/oj 5/68(29) The introduction of minimum energy perf ormance standards should be accom panied by an enabling framew ork 
including technical assistance and financial measures, in particular for vulnerable households. Minimum energy 
perf ormance standards set at national level do not amount to ‘Union standards’ within the meaning of State aid 
rules, while Union-wide minimum energy performance standards might be considered to constitute such ‘Union 
standards’. In line with revised State aid rules, Member States may grant State aid to building renovati on to comp ly 
with the Union-wide energy perfo rmance standards until those Union-wide standards become mandator y. Once the 
standards are mandato ry, Member States may continue to grant State aid for the reno vation of buildings and building 
units falling under the Union-wide energy perf ormance standards, provid ed that the building reno vation aims at 
a higher standard.
(30) The EU Taxonomy , established by Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council (15), 
classifies environmentally sustainable economic activities across the economy , including for the building secto r. 
Und er Commission Delegat ed Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 (16) (the ‘EU Taxonomy Climate Delegat ed Act’), building 
reno vation is considered to be a sustainable activity where it achieves at least 30 % energy savings, comp lies with 
minimum energy perf ormance requirements for major reno vation of existing buildings, or consists of individual 
measures related to the energy perfor mance of buildings, such as the installation, maintenance or repair of energy 
efficiency equipment or of instr uments and devices for measur ing, regulating and controlling the energy 
perf ormance of buildings, where such individual measures comply with the established criteria. Building renova tion 
to comply with Union-wide minimum energy perfo rmance standards is typically in line with the EU Taxonomy 
criteria relate d to building renova tion activities.
(31) Minimum energy perf ormance requirements for existing buildings and building elements were already contained in 
the predecessors of this Directive and should continue to apply . While the newly introduced minimum energy 
perf ormance standards set a minimum level for the energy perfo rmance of existing buildings and ensure that 
reno vation of ineff icient buildings takes place, minimum energy performance requirements for existing buildings 
and building elements ensure the necessar y depth of reno vation when a renovation take s place.
(32) There is an urgent need to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels in buildings and to accelerate efforts to decarbonise 
and electr ify their energy consump tion. In order to enable the cost-effective installation of solar technologies at 
a later stage , all new buildings should be ‘solar -ready’, that is, designed to opti mise the solar generation potential on 
the basis of the site’s solar irradiance, enabling the installation of solar technologies without costly structural 
interventions. In addition, Member States should ensure the deplo yment of suitable solar installations on new 
buildings, both residential and non-residential, and on existing non-residential buildings. The large-scale deplo yment 
of solar energy on buildings would make a major contr ibution to shielding more effectively consumers from 
increasing and volatile prices of fossil fuels, reduce the exposure of vulnerable citizens to high energy costs and result 
in wider environmental, economic and social benef its. In order to efficiently exploit the potential of solar 
installations on buildings, Member States should establish criteria for the implementation of, and possible 
exemp tions from, the deplo yment of solar installations on buildings, in line with the assessed technical and 
economic potential of the solar energy installations and the charact eristics of the buildings covered by this 
oblig ation, taking into account the principle of technology neutrality and the combination of solar installations with 
other roof uses, such as green roofs or other building services installations. In their criteria for the practical 
implementation of the oblig ations of deplo yment of suitable solar energy installation on buildings, Member States 
should be able to express the relevant threshold in terms of the building’s ground floor area instead of the building’s 
useful floor area, provid ed that such a method corresponds to an equivalent installed capacity of suitable solar 
energy installation on buildings. As the obligation to deplo y solar installations on individual buildings depends on 
the criteria established by Member States, the provis ions on solar energy on buildings do not qualify as a ‘Union 
standard’ within the meaning of State aid rules.EN OJ L, 8.5.2024

facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (OJ L 198, 22.6.2020, p. 13).
(16) Commission Delegat ed Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 of 4 June 2021 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European 
Parliament and of the Council by establishing the technical screening criteria for determining the conditions under whic h an 
economic activity qualifies as contr ibuting substantially to climate chang e mitig ation or climate change adaptation and for 
determining whether that economic activity causes no significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives (OJ L 442, 
9.12.2021, p. 1).(33) It should be possible for Member States to encourage, by means of information, appropr iate administrative 
procedures or other measures that are set out in their national building renova tion plans, the deplo yment of suitable 
solar energy installations in combination with the renovation of the building envelope, with the replacement of 
technical building systems or with the installation of recharging infrastr ucture for electr ic vehicles, of heat pumps or 
of building automat ion and control systems.
(34) With regard to mixed-used buildings that include both residential and non-residential building units, Member States 
may continue to choose whether to treat them as residential or non-residential buildings.
(35) Solar phot ovoltaics and solar ther mal technologies, including in combination with energy storage, should be rolled 
out rapidly to benefit both the climate and the financ es of citizens and businesses.
(36) The electr ification of buildings, such as through the deplo yment of heat pumps, solar installations, batt eries and 
recharging infrastr ucture, changes the risks with rega rd to the fire safety of buildings, which Member States need to 
address. As rega rds fire safety in car parks, the Commission should publish non-binding guidance for Member States.
(37) To achieve a highly energy-eff icient and decarbonised building stoc k and the transf ormation of existing buildings 
into zero-emission buildings by 2050, Member States should establish national building renova tion plans which 
replace the long-t erm renovation strate gies provided for in Article 2a of Directive 2010/31/EU and which are to 
become an even stronger , fully operational planning tool for Member States, in line with the ‘energy efficiency first’ 
principle, with a stronger focus on financing and ensur ing that appropr iately skilled workers are availa ble for 
carrying out building renova tions Member States may take into account the Pact for Skills set out in the 
communication of the Commission of 1 July 2020 entitled ‘European Skills Agenda for sustainable comp etitiveness, 
social fairne ss and resilience’. In their national building reno vation plans, Member States should set their own 
national building renovation targe ts. In accordance with Article 21, point (b)(7), of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 and 
with the enabling conditions set under Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 of the European Parliament and of the 
Council (17), Member States should provide an outline of financing measures, as well as an outline of the investment 
needs and the administrative resources for the implementation of their national building reno vation plans.
(38) The ‘energy efficiency first ’ principle is an overarc hing principle that should be take n into account across all sectors, 
going beyond the energy system, at all levels. It is defined in Article 2, point (18), of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 as 
meaning to take utmost account in energy planning, and in policy and investment decisions, of alter native 
cost-efficient energy efficiency measures to make energy demand and energy supply more efficient, in particular by 
means of cost-eff ective end-use energy savings, demand-response initiatives and more efficient conve rsion, 
transmission and distr ibution of energy , whilst still achieving the objectives of those decisions. The principle is 
theref ore equally relevant with rega rd to impro ving the energy perfo rmance of buildings and is highlighte d in the 
Renova tion Wave strategy as one of the key principles for building renova tion towards 2030 and 2050. As set out in 
Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/1749 (18), impro ved health and well-being are among the major 
co-benefits of applying the ‘energy efficiency first’ principle to imp rove the energy performance of buildings.
(39) In order to ensure that the Union’s workf orce is fully prepared to work actively towards the achievement of the 
Union climate objectives, Member States should encourage under -represented groups to train and work in the 
constr uction and building secto r.
(40) The national building renova tion plans should be based on a harmonised template in order to ensure comparability 
of plans. In order to ensure the required ambition, the Commission should assess the draf t national building 
reno vation plans and issue recommendations to Member States.
(41) The national building renovation plans should be closely linked with the integrat ed national energy and climat e 
plans under Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, and progress in achieving the national targets and the contr ibution of the 
national building renova tion plans to national and Union targets should be repor ted as part of the biennial repor ting OJ L, 8.5.2024 EN

European Mar itime, Fisher ies and Aquaculture Fund and financial rules for those and for the Asylum, Migration and Integration 
Fund, the Internal Secur ity Fund and the Instr ument for Financial Suppor t for Border Management and Visa Policy (OJ L 231,

Guidelines and examples for its implementation in decision-making in the energy sector and beyond (OJ L 350, 4.10.2021, p. 9).under Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. Consider ing the urgency to scale up renovation on the basis of solid national 
building renovation plans, the date for the submission of the first national building renova tion plan should be set as 
early as possible. The subsequent national building reno vation plans should be submitt ed as part of the integrated 
national energy and climate plans and their update s, which means that the second draf t national building renova tion 
plan should be submitt ed with the second draf t integrated national energy and climate plans in 2028.
(42) A stage d deep reno vation can be a solution to address high upfront costs and hassle for the inhabitants that may 
occur when reno vating ‘in one go’ and can allow for less disruptive and more financ ially feasible renova tion 
measures. How ever , such stage d deep reno vation needs to be carefully planned in order to avoid that one renova tion 
step precludes necessar y subsequent steps. One-st ep deep reno vation can be more cost-eff ective and result in fewer 
emissions linked to the renovation than stage d renovation. Renova tion passpor ts provide a clear roadmap for staged 
deep renovations, helping owners and investors plan the best timing and scope for inter ventions. Theref ore, 
reno vation passpor ts should be encouraged and made available, as a voluntar y tool, to building owners across all 
Member States. Member States should ensure that renovation passpor ts do not create a dispropor tionate burden.
(43) There are some synergies between renova tion passpor ts and energy perf ormance certificates, in particular as regard s 
the assessment of the current perfor mance of the building and the recommendations for its impro vement. In order 
to make the most of those synergies and reduce costs for building owners, Member States should be able to allow the 
reno vation passpor t and the energy perf ormance certificate to be drawn up jointly by the same exper t and issued 
together . In the case of such joint drawing up and issuing, the renovation passpor t should substitut e the 
recommendations in the energy perf ormance certificate. It should, however , remain possible to obtain an energy 
perf ormance certificate without a reno vation passpor t.
(44) Long-t erm renovation contracts are an imp ortant instr ument by means of which to stimulate staged renovation. 
Member States may introduce mechanisms that allow the establishment of long-term renovation contracts over the 
various stages of stage d renova tion. Where new and more effective incentives become available during the various 
stage s of the renovation, access to those new incentives may be ensured by allowing benefi ciaries to switch to new 
incentives.
(45) The concept of ‘deep renovation’ has not yet been defined in Union law. With a view to achieving the long-t erm 
vision for buildings, deep renova tion should be defined as a reno vation that transf orms buildings into zero-emission 
buildings but, as a first step, as a renova tion that transf orms buildings into nearly zero-energy buildings. This 
definition serves the purpose of increasing the energy perf ormance of buildings. A deep renova tion for energy 
perf ormance purposes may also be a prime oppor tunity to address other aspects such as indoor envir onmental 
quality , living conditions of vulnerable households, increasing climate resilience, resilience against disaster risks 
including seismic resilience, fire safety, the removal of hazardous substances including asbest os, and accessibility for 
persons with disabilities.
(46) In order to foster deep reno vation, which is one of the goals of the Renovat ion Wave strategy , Member States should 
give enhanced financial and administrative suppor t to deep renova tion.
(47) Member States should suppor t energy performance upgrades of existing buildings that contr ibut e to achi eving an 
adequat e level of indoor environmental quality , removi ng asbesto s and other harmful substances, preventing the 
illega l remova l of harmful substances, and facilitating compliance with existing legislative acts such as Directives 
2009/148/EC (19) and (EU) 2016/2284 (20) of the European Parliament and of the Council.
(48) Integrate d distr ict or neighbourhood approac hes help to increase the cost-eff ectiveness of the reno vations required 
for buildings that are spatially related such as housing blocks. Such approac hes to renova tions offer a variety of 
solutions at a larger scale.EN OJ L, 8.5.2024

risks related to exposure to asbestos at work (OJ L 330, 16.12.2009, p. 28).
(20) Directive (EU) 2016/2284 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2016 on the reduction of national

17.12.2016, p. 1).(49) Electr ic vehicles are expected to play a crucial role in the decarbonisation and effici ency of the electr icity syste m, 
namely through the provision of flexibility , balancing and storage services, especially through aggrega tion. This 
pote ntial of electr ic vehicles to integrat e with the electr icity syste m and contr ibute to system efficiency and further 
absor ption of renewable electr icity should be fully exploited. Rech arging in relation to buildings is particularly 
important, since this is where electr ic vehicles park regularly and for long periods of time. Slow recharg ing is 
economical and the installation of recharg ing points in private spaces can provide energy storag e to the related 
building and integrat ion of smar t recharg ing services and bi-directional recharg ing and syste m integration services in 
general.
(50) Combined with an increased share of renewable electr icity production, electr ic vehicles produce less greenhouse gas 
emissions. Electr ic vehicles constitute an imp ortant compo nent of a clean energy transition on the basis of energy 
efficiency measures, alter native fuels, renewable energy and innovative solutions for the manag ement of energy 
flexibility . Building codes can be effectively used to introduce targe ted requirements to suppor t the deplo yment of 
recharging infrastr ucture in car park s of residential and non-residential buildings. Member States should aim to 
remo ve barriers such as split incentives and administrative comp lications which individual owners encounter when 
trying to install a recharging point on their parking space.
(51) Pre-cabling and ducting facilitate the rapid deplo yment of recharg ing points if and where they are needed. Readily 
available infrastr ucture will decrease the costs of installation of recharging points for individual owners and ensure 
that electr ic vehicle users have access to recharg ing points. Establishing requirements for electromobility at Union 
level concer ning the pre-equipping of parking spaces and the installation of recharging points is an effective way to 
promot e electr ic vehicles in the near future while enabling further development at a reduced cost in the medium to 
long term. Where technically feasible, Member States should ensure the accessibility of recharg ing points for persons 
with disabilities.
(52) Smar t recharg ing and bi-directional recharging enable the energy syste m integration of buildings. Recharging points 
where electr ic vehicles typically park for extended periods of time, such as where people park for reasons of 
residence or emplo yment, are highly relevant to energy system integration, theref ore smar t recharg ing functionalities 
need to be ensured. In situations where bi-directional recharg ing would assist further penetration of renewable 
electr icity by electr ic vehicle fleets in transpor t and the electr icity syste m in general, such functionality should also be 
made available .
(53) Promoting green mobility is a key part of the European Green Deal and buildings can play an imp ortant role in 
providing the necessar y infrastr ucture, not only for recharging of electr ic vehicles but also for bicy cles. A shift to 
active mobility such as cycling can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transpor t. With the increase 
in the sale of electr ically power -assist ed cycles and other L-categor y vehicle types, referred to in Article 4 of 
Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 of the European Parliame nt and of the Council (21), and in order to facilitate the 
installation of recharging points at a later stage, pre-cabling or ducting should be required in new residential 
buildings and, where technically and economically feasible, in residential buildings undergoing major renovati on. As 
set out in the communication of the Commission of 17 September 2020 on ‘Stepping up Europe’ s 2030 climat e 
ambition — Investing in a climate-neu tral future for the benefit of our people ’ (the ‘Climate Target Plan’), increasing 
the modal shares of clean and efficient private and public transpor t, such as cycling, will drastically lower pollution 
from transpor t and bring majo r benefits to individual citizens and communities. The lack of bicy cle parking spaces is 
a major barrier to the uptake of cycling, both in residential and non-residential buildings. Union requirements and 
national building codes can effectively suppor t the transition to cleaner mobility by establishing requirements for 
a minimum number of bicy cle parking spaces, and building bicy cle parking spaces and related infrastr ucture in areas 
where bicy cles are less used can lead to an increase in their use. The requirement to provid e bicy cle parking spaces 
should not depend on, or necessar ily be linke d to, the availa bility and supply of car parking spaces, which may be 
unavailable in certain circumstances. Member States should allow an increase in bicy cle parking in residential 
buildings where there are no car parking spaces by provid ing for the installation of at least two bicy cle parking 
spaces for ever y residential building unit.
(54) The agendas of the Digital Sing le Market and the Energy Union should be aligned and should serve common goals. 
The digitalisation of the energy system is quick ly changing the energy landscape, from the integration of renewables 
to smar t grids and smar t-ready buildings. In order to digitalise the building sector , the Union’s connectivity targ ets OJ L, 8.5.2024 EN
ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2024/1275/oj 9/68(21) Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 Januar y 2013 on the approval and market 
surveillance of two- or three-wheel vehicles and quadr icycles (OJ L 60, 2.3.2013, p. 52).and ambitions for the deplo yment of high-capacity communication networks are important for smar t homes and 
well-connect ed communities. Target ed incentives should be provided to promot e smar t-ready syste ms and digital 
solutions in the built environment. This would offer new oppor tunities for energy savings, by providing consumers 
with more accurat e information about their consump tion patterns, and by enabling the system operat or to manage 
the grid more effectively . Member States should encourage the use of digital technologies for analysis, simulation and 
manag ement of buildings, including with rega rd to deep renova tions.
(55) In order to facilitat e a competitive and inno vative market for smar t building services that contr ibut es to efficient 
energy use and integrat ion of renewable energy in buildings and suppor t invest ments in renovation, Member States 
should ensure direct access to building systems’ data by interest ed parties. To avoid excessive administrative costs for 
third parties, Member States shall facilitate the full interoperability of services and of the data exchang e within the 
Union.
(56) The smar t readiness indicator should be used to measure the capacity of buildings to use information and 
communication technologies and electronic systems to adap t the operation of buildings to the needs of the 
occupants and the grid and to imp rove the energy efficiency and overall perfo rmance of buildings. The smar t 
readiness indicator should raise awareness among building owners and occupants of the value behind building 
auto mation and electronic monitoring of technical building syste ms and should give conf idence to occupants about 
the actual savings of those new enhanced-functionalities. The smar t readiness indicator is particularly benef icial for 
large buildings with a high energy demand. For other buildings, the scheme for rating the smar t readiness of 
buildings should be optional for Member States.
(57) A digital building twin is an interactive and dynamic simulation that reflects the real-time status and behaviour of 
a physica l building. By incor porating real-time data from sensors, smar t meter s and other sources, a digital building 
twin provid es a holistic view of the building’s perfo rmance, including energy consump tion, temperature, humidity , 
occupancy levels, and more and can be used to monitor and manage the building’s energy consump tion. Where 
a digital building twin is available, it should be taken into account, in particular for the smar t readiness indicator .
(58) Access to sufficient funding is crucial to meet the 2030 and 2050 energy and climat e targets. Union financial 
instr uments and other measures have been put into place or adapt ed with the aim of suppor ting the energy 
perf ormance of buildings. The most recent initiatives to increase the availability of financ ing at Union level include, 
inter alia, the ‘Reno vate’ flagship comp onent of the Recove ry and Resilience Facility, in particular the REP owerEU 
plan, and the Social Climat e Fund established by Regulation (EU) 2023/955 of the European Parliament and of the 
Council (22).
(59) Union financ ial instr uments should be used to give practical effect to the objectives of this Directive, without 
replacing national measures. In particular , due to the scale of the renovation effort needed, they should be used for 
providing appropr iate and inno vative means of financ ing to catalyse invest ment in the energy perf ormance of 
buildings. They could play an impor tant role in the development of national, regional and local energy efficiency 
funds, instr uments and mechanisms which deliver such financing possibilities to private proper ty owner s, to small 
and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and to energy efficiency service com panies.
(60) Financial mec hanisms, incentives and the mobilisation of financ ial institutions for energy renovations in buildings 
should play a central role in national building reno vation plans and be actively promot ed by Member States. Such 
measures should include encouraging energy-eff icient mor tgag es for certified energy-efficient building renova tions, 
promoting investments for public bodies in an energy-eff icient building stock, for exam ple by public-pr ivate 
partnerships or energy perf ormance contracts or reducing the perceived risk of the investments. Information about 
available funding and financial tools should be made available to the public in an easily accessible and transparent 
manner . Member States should encourag e financial institutions to promot e targe ted financial products, grants and 
subsidies to impro ve the energy perfo rmance of buildings housing vulnerable households, as well as to owners in EN OJ L, 8.5.2024
10/68 ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2024/1275/oj(22) Regulation (EU) 2023/955 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 May 2023 establishing a Social Climate Fund and 
amending Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 (OJ L 130, 16.5.2023, p. 1).worst-per forming buildings with multiple residential building units and buildings in rural areas, and other groups for 
whom access to financing is difficult. The Commission should adop t a voluntar y framework to help financial 
institutions target and increase lending volumes in accordance with the Union’s decarbonisation ambition and 
relevant energy targe ts.
(61) Green mor tgages and green loans can signifi cantly contr ibut e to transf orming the economy and reducing carbon 
emissions.
(62) Financing alone will not deliver on the reno vation needs. Together with financing, setting up accessible and 
transparent advisor y tools and assistance instr uments such as one-sto p shops that provide integrat ed energy 
reno vation services or facilitators, as well as imp lementing other measures and initiatives such as those referred to in 
the Commission’s Smar t Finance for Smar t Buildings Initiative, is indispensable to provid e the right enabling 
framew ork and break barriers to renova tion. One-st op shops should provide technical assistance and be easily 
available to all those involved in building renovati ons, including homeowners and administrative, financial and 
economic actor s, such as SMEs, including microenterpr ises.
(63) Inefficient buildings are often linked to energy pover ty and social problems. Vulnerable households are particularly 
exposed to increasing energy prices as they spend a larger propor tion of their budg et on energy products. By 
reducing excessive energy bills, building renovation can lift people out of energy poverty and can also prevent 
energy poverty. At the same time, building reno vation does not come for free, and it is essential to ensure that the 
social imp act of the costs for building renova tion, in particular on vulnerable households, is kept in check. The 
Renova tion Wave strate gy should leave no one behind and be seized as an oppor tunity to imp rove the situation of 
vulnerable households, and a fair transition towards climate neutrality should be ensured. Theref ore, financial 
incentives and other policy measures should as a priority targe t vulnerable households, people affected by energy 
poverty and people living in social housing, and Member States should take measures to prevent evictions because of 
reno vation, such as caps on rent increases. Council Recommendation of 16 June 2022 (23) provides a common 
framew ork and shared understanding of comp rehensive policies and investments needed for ensur ing that the 
transition is fair.
(64) Microent erprises represent 94 % of comp anies active in the building sector . Together with small enterprises, they 
amount to 70 % of emplo yment in the constr uction sector . They supply essential services and jobs locally . How ever , 
as microenterp rises typically rely on fewer than 10 emp loyees, they have limit ed resources to comply with 
regulat ory requirements and rules attac hed to financial suppor t programmes schemes. Energy communities, 
citizen-led initiatives and local author ities and energy agencies, while indispensable for deliver ing the Renova tion 
Wave, face the same issues of lower administrative, financial and organisational capacities. This should not hamper 
the essential role of such entities and should be take n into account in the development of suppor t and training 
programmes, with sufficient visibility and ease of access. Member States may actively suppor t organisations with 
lower means with dedicated technical, financ ial and lega l assistance.
(65) Energy perf ormance certificates for buildings have been in use since 2002. However , the use of different scales and 
formats hinders the comp arability between different national schemes. Great er comp arability of energy perf ormance 
certificates across the Union facilitat es the use of such certificates by financ ial institutions, thereby steeri ng financ ing 
towards buildings with better energy perf ormance and building renovation. The EU Taxonomy relies on the use of 
energy perf ormance certificates and accentuates the need to imp rove their comparability . Introducing a common 
scale of energy perf ormance classes and a common template should ensure sufficient comparability between energy 
perf ormance certificates across the Union.OJ L, 8.5.2024 EN
ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2024/1275/oj 11/68(23) Council Recommendation of 16 June 2022 on ensur ing a fair transition towards climate neutrality (OJ C 243, 27.6.2022, p. 35).(66) A number of Member States have recently modifi ed their energy perfor mance certification sche mes. In order to 
avoid disrupti on, those Member States should have additional time to adap t their schemes.
(67) In order to ensure that the energy perfo rmance of buildings can be take n into account by prospective buyers or 
tenants early in the process, buildings or building units which are offered for sale or rent should have an energy 
perf ormance certificate, and the energy perf ormance class and indicator should be stated in all adver tisements. The 
prospective buyer or tenant of a building or building unit should, in the energy perfo rmance certificate, be given 
correct information about the energy perfor mance of the building and practical advice on impro ving such 
perf ormance. The energy perfor mance certificate should also provide information on its primar y and final energy 
consump tion, energy needs, renewable energy production, greenhouse gas emissions, life-cy cle GWP if availa ble, 
and, as an option, its indoor envir onmental quality sensors or controls. The energy perfo rmance certificate should 
contain recommendations for the imp rovement of the energy perf ormance of the building.
(68) The monitoring of the building stoc k is facilitate d by the availa bility of data collect ed by digital tools, thereby 
reducing administrative costs. Theref ore, national databases for the energy perfor mance of buildings should be set 
up, and the information contained therein should be transf erred to the EU Building Stoc k Obser vatory.
(69) Buildings owned or occupied by public bodies should set an exam ple by showing that environmental and energy 
factor s are taken into account. Those buildings should theref ore be subject to energy certification on a regular basis. 
The dissemination to the public of information on the energy perf ormance of buildings should be enhanced by 
clearly displa ying those energy perf ormance certificates, in particular in buildings which are occupied by public 
bodies and which are frequently visite d by the public and certain non-residential buildings, such as town halls, 
schools, shops and shopping centres, super marke ts, restaurants, theatres, banks and hote ls.
(70) Recent years have seen a rise in the number of air-conditioning syste ms in European countr ies. That create s 
considerable problems at peak load times, increasing the cost of electr icity and disrupting the energy balance. 
Priority should be given to strategie s which enhance the ther mal perfo rmance of buildings during the summer 
period. To that end, there should be a focus on measures which avoid overheating, such as shading and sufficient 
ther mal capacity in the building constr uction, and further development and application of passive cooling 
techniques, primar ily those that imp rove indoor environmental quality , the micro-climate around buildings and the 
urban heat island effect.
(71) Regular mainte nance and inspection of heating syste ms, ventilation syste ms and air-conditioning syste ms by 
qualified personnel contr ibut es to maintaining their correct adjustment in accordance with the product specif ication 
and in that way ensures optimal perfo rmance from an environmental, safety and energy point of view . An 
independent assessment of the entire heating syste m, ventilation system and air-conditioning syste m should occur at 
regular inter vals during its lifecy cle in particular before its replacement or upgrading. Inspections should address the 
parts of the systems that are accessible either directly or indirectly through availa ble non-destr uctive methods. In 
order to minimise the administrative burden on building owner s and tenants, Member States should endeav our to 
combine inspections and certifications as far as possible. Where a ventilation system is installed, its sizing and its 
capabilities to opti mise its perf ormance under typical or average operating conditions relevant for the specific and 
current use of the building should also be assessed.
(72) Where the syste m to be inspected is based on fossil fuels, the inspection should include a basic assessment of the 
feasibility to reduce the on-sit e use of fossil fuels, for exam ple by integrat ing renewable energy , changing energy 
source, or replacing or adjusting the existing syste ms. In order to reduce the burden on users, that assessment should 
not be repeat ed if such recommendations are already documente d, in the context of an energy perf ormance 
certificate, renova tion passpor ts, energy audit, recommendations from the manufa cturer or other means of 
providing advice in an equivalent official document or if the replacement of the syste m is already planned.
(73) Some heating syste ms involve a high risk of carbon mono xide into xication, depending on the type of heat generator 
(boiler , heat pump), the type of fuel (coal, oil, biomass, gas) or the location of the heat generator (suc h as within 
living spaces or in spaces not properly ventilated). Inspections of such syste ms provide a good oppor tunity for 
managing those risks.
(74) A common approac h to the energy perform ance certification of buildings, renovation passpor ts, smar t readiness 
indicato rs and to the inspection of heating syste ms and air-conditioning systems, carried out by qualified or certified 
accredit ed exper ts, whose independence is to be guaranteed on the basis of objective criteria, will contr ibute to 
a level playing field as regard s efforts made in Member States relate d to energy savings in the buildings sector and 
will introduce transparency for prospective owners or users with rega rd to energy perfor mance in the Union EN OJ L, 8.5.2024
12/68 ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2024/1275/ojproper ty market. Exper ts should benef it from using test equipment certified in accordance with EN and ISO 
standards. In order to ensure the quality of energy perfo rmance certificates, renova tion passpor ts, smar t readiness 
indicato rs and of the inspection of heating syste ms and air-conditioning syste ms throughout the Union, an 
independent control syste m should be established in each Member State.
(75) A sufficient number of reliable professionals compet ent in the field of energy renovation should be available to 
ensure sufficient capacity to carry out quality renova tion works at the required scale. Member States should 
theref ore, where appropr iate and feasible, put in place certification schemes for integrated renova tion works, which 
require exper tise in various building elements or systems such as building insulation, electr icity and heating syste ms 
and the installation of solar technologi es; prof essionals involved may include designers, general contractors , 
specialist contractors and installers.
(76) Since local and regional author ities are critical for the successful impl ementation of this Directive, they should be 
consult ed and involved, as and when appropr iate in accordance with applicable national law, on planning issues, the 
development of programmes to provide information, training and awareness-raising, and on the imp lementation of 
this Directive at national or regional level. Such consultations may also serve to promot e the provision of adequate 
guidance to local planners and building inspect ors to carry out the necessar y tasks . Further more, Member States 
should enable and encourage archit ects, planners and engineers to properly consider the optimal combination of 
improvements in energy efficiency , use of energy from renewable sources and use of distr ict heating and cooling 
when planning, designing, building and renovating industr ial or residential areas, including building modelling and 
simulation technologies.
(77) Installers and builders are critical for the successful imp lementation of this Directive. Theref ore, an adequat e number 
of installers and builders should, through training and other measures, have the appropr iate level of compet ence for 
the installation and integration of the energy-eff icient and renewable energy technology required.
(78) In order to further the aim of imp roving the energy perfo rmance of buildings, the power to adop t acts in accordance 
with Article 290 TFEU should be delegat ed to the Commission in respect of the adap tation to technical progress of 
certain parts of the general framework set out in Annex I, in respect of the establishment of a comparative 
methodology framew ork for calculating cost-optim al levels of minimum energy perfo rmance requirements, in 
respect of setting out a Union framew ork for the national calculation of life-cy cle GWP with a view to achieving 
climat e neutrality , in respect of a Union scheme for rating the smar t readiness of buildings and to effectively 
encourag e financial institutions to increase volumes provid ed for energy perfo rmance renova tions by means of 
a comp rehensive portfolio framework for voluntar y use by financial institutions. It is of particular imp ortance that 
the Commission carry out appropr iate consultations during its preparat ory work, including at exper t level, and that 
those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 
13 Apr il 2016 on Better Law -Making (24). In particular , to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegat ed 
acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ exper ts, and 
their exper ts systema tically have access to meetings of Commission exper t groups dealing with the preparation of 
deleg ated acts.
(79) In order to ensure an effective imp lementation of the provisions laid down in this Directive, the Commission 
suppor ts Member States through various tools, such as the Technical Suppor t Instr ument established by Regulation 
(EU) 2021/240 of the European Parliame nt and of the Council (25) providing tailor -made technical exper tise to 
design and implement reforms, including those aimed at increasing the annual energy renova tion rate of residential 
and non-residential buildings by 2030 and to foster deep energy renova tions. The technical suppor t relates to, for 
exam ple, strengthening of administrative capacity , suppor ting policy development and imp lementation, and shar ing 
of relevant best practices.
(80) Since the objectives of this Directive, namely imp roving the energy perf ormance of buildings and reducing the 
greenhouse gas emissions from buildings, cannot be suffi ciently achieved by the Member States, due to the 
com plexity of the buildings sector and the inability of the national housing markets to adequat ely address the 
challeng es of energy efficiency , but can rather , by reason of the scale and the effects of the action, be better achieved OJ L, 8.5.2024 EN

Declaration of 28 Sept ember 2011 of Member States and the Commission on explanato ry documents, Member 
States have under take n to accompan y, in justified cases, the notification of their transposition measures with one or 
more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts of

fifth subparagraph.EN OJ L, 8.5.2024
24/68 ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2024/1275/ojThe maximum energy perform ance thresholds shall be established on the basis of the non-residential building stock on 
1 Januar y 2020, based on available information and, where appropr iate, on statistical sampling. Member States shall 
exclude from the baseline non-residential buildings that they exem pt pursuant to paragraph 6.
Each Member State shall set a maximum energy perform ance threshold to the effect that 16 % of its national non-residential 
building stock is above that threshold (the ‘16 % threshold’). Each Member State shall also set a maximum energy 
perfo rmance threshold to the effect that 26 % of its national non-residential building stock is above that threshold (the 
‘26 % threshold’). Member States may set the maximum energy perf ormance thresholds with reference to the national 
non-residential building stoc k as a whole or per building type or categor y of building.
Member States may set the thresholds at a level corresponding to a specific energy performance class, provided that they 
comply with the third subparagraph.
The minimum energy perf ormance standards shall ensure, at least, that all non-residential buildings are below:
(a)the 16 % threshold from 2030; and
(b)the 26 % threshold from 2033.
Complianc e of individual non-residential buildings with the thresholds shall be chec ked on the basis of energy perf ormance 
certificates or, where appropr iate, other available means.
In their roadmaps as refer red to in Article 3(1), point (b), Member States shall establish specific timelines for non-residential 
buildings to comply with lower maximum energy performance thresholds by 2040 and 2050, in line with the pathwa y for 
transf orming the national building stoc k into zero-emission buildings.
Member States may establish and publish criteria to exemp t individual non-residential buildings, in light of the expected 
future use of those buildings, in light of serious hardship or in the case of an unfa vourable cost-benefi t assessment, from 
requirements in this paragraph. Any such criteria shall be clear , precise and stringent and shall ensure equal treatment 
between non-residential buildings. When establishing those criteria Member States shall enable the ex ante assessment of the 
potent ial share of non-residential buildings covered and shall avoid a dispropor tionate number of non-residential buildings 
from being exemp ted. Member States shall also repor t on the criteria as part of their national building renovation plans 
submitted to the Commission pursuant to Article 3.
Where Member States establish criteria for exemp tions pursuant to the eighth subparagraph, they shall achieve equivalent 
energy perf ormance imp rovements in other parts of the non-residential building stoc k.
Where the overall reno vation necessar y to achi eve the energy performance thresholds specif ied in this paragraph has an 
unfa vourable cost-benefi t assessment for a given non-residential building, Member States shall require that, for that given 
non-residential building, at least those individual renovation measures with a favourable cost-benefi t assessment are 
imp lemented.
To the extent that the national non-residential building stoc k, or part of it, is seriously damage d by a natural disaster , 
a Member State may temporar ily adjust the maximum energy perfo rmance threshold so that the energy renovation of 
damage d non-residential buildings replaces the energy renova tion of other wors t-per forming non-residential buildings, 
whilst ensur ing that a similar percentage of the non-residential building stock undergoes energy renova tion. In that case, the 
Member State shall repor t the adjustment and its project ed length in its national building renova tion plan.
2. By 29 May 2026, each Member State shall establish a national traject ory for the progressive renova tion of the 
residential building stoc k in line with the national roadmap and the 2030, 2040 and 2050 targ ets contained in the Member 
State’s national building renovati on plan and with the aim of transf orming the national building stoc k into a zero-emission 
building stoc k by 2050. The national traje ctory for the progressive renovation of the residential building stock shall be 
expressed as a decrease in the average primar y energy use in kWh/(m2.y) of the entire residential building stock over the 
period from 2020 to 2050, and shall identify the number of residential buildings and residential building units or floor area 
to be renovat ed annually , including the number or floor area of the 43 % wors t-per forming residential buildings and 
residential building units.OJ L, 8.5.2024 EN
ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2024/1275/oj 25/68Member States shall ensure that the average primar y energy use in kWh/(m2.y) of the entire residential building stock:
(a)decreases by at least 16 % compared to 2020 by 2030;
(b)decreases by at least 20-22 % comp ared to 2020 by 2035;
(c)by 2040, and ever y 5 years thereaf ter, is equivalent to, or lower than the nationally determined value derived from 
a progressive decrease in the average primar y energy use from 2030 to 2050, in line with the transf ormation of the 
residential building stoc k into a zero-emission building stock.
Member States shall ensure that at least 55 % of the decrease in the average primar y energy use referred to in the third 
subparagraph is achieved through the renovation of the 43 % worst-perf orming residential buildings. Member States may 
count the decrease in the average primar y energy use achieved by the reno vation of residential buildings affected by natural 
disasters such as earthquakes and floods towards the share achieved by means of the renova tion of the 43 % 
worst-per forming residential buildings.
In their renova tion efforts to achieve the required decrease in the average primar y energy use of the entire residential 
building stoc k, Member States shall put in place measures such as minimum energy perf ormance standards, technical 
assistance and financial suppor t measures.
In their renova tion efforts, Member States shall not dispropor tionate ly exemp t rental residential buildings or building units.
Member States shall repor t in the national building renova tion plans the methodology used and data gathered for 
estimating the values referred to in the second and third subparagraphs. As part of the assessment of national building 
renova tion plans, the Commission shall monitor the achi evement of the values referred to in the second and third 
subparagraphs, including the number of buildings and building units or floor area of the 43 % worst-perf orming residential 
buildings, and mak e recommendations where necessar y. Those recommendations may include a more exte nsive use of 
minimum energy perf ormance standards.
The national traject ory for the progressive renova tion of the residential building stock shall refer to data on the national 
residential building stoc k, based, as appropr iate, on statistical sam pling and energy performance certificates.
If the average fossil share of energy use in residential buildings is lower than 15 %, Member States may adjust the levels laid 
down in the points (a) and (b) of the third subparagraph, to ensure that the average primar y energy use in kWh/(m2.y) of the 
entire residential building stock by 2030, and ever y five years thereaf ter, is equivalent to, or lower than a nationally 
determined value derived from a linear decrease in the average primar y energy use from 2020 to 2050, in line with the 
transf ormation of the residential building stock into a zero-emission building stock.
3. In addition to primar y energy use refer red to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, Member States may establish 
additional indicators of non-renewable and renewable primar y energy use, and of operational greenhouse gas emissions 
produced in kgC O2eq/(m2.y). In order to ensure reduction of operational greenhouse gas emissions, minimum energy 
perfo rmance standards shall take into account Article 15a(1) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001.

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2024/1275/oj 47/68ANNEX I
Common general framew ork for the calculation of the energy perfor mance of buildings
(refer red to in Article 4)
1.The energy perf ormance of a building shall be determ ined on the basis of calculate d or metered energy use and shall 
reflect typical energy use for space heating, space cooling, domestic hot water , ventilation, built-in lighting and other 
technical building systems. Member States shall ensure that the typical energy use is representative of actual operating 
conditions for each relevant typology and reflects the typical user behavi our. Where possible, typical energy use and 
typical user behavio ur shall be based on available national statistics, building codes and meter ed data.
Where metered energy use is the basis for calculating the energy perf ormance of buildings, the calculation methodology 
shall be capable of identifying the influence of the behavio ur of occupants and the local climate, which shall not be 
reflected in the result of the calculation. Metered energy use for the purpose of calculating the energy perfo rmance of 
buildings shall require readings of at least monthly inter vals and must differentiat e between energy carriers.
Member States may use metered energy consump tion under typical operating conditions to verify the correctness of the 
calculated energy use and enable comp arison between calculated and actual perf ormance. Metered energy consump tion 
for the purposes of verification and comp arison may be based on monthly readings.
The energy performance of a building shall be expressed by a numer ic indicator of primar y energy use per unit of 
refere nce floor area per year , in kWh/(m2.y) for the purposes of both energy performance certification and compliance 
with minimum energy perform ance requirements. The methodology applied for the determin ation of the energy 
perfo rmance of a building shall be transparent and open to innovation.
Member States shall descr ibe their national calculation methodology on the basis of Annex A to the key European 
standards on the energy perf ormance of buildings, namely (EN) ISO 52000-1, (EN) ISO 52003-1, (EN) ISO 52010-1, 
(EN) ISO 52016-1, (EN) ISO 52018-1, (EN) ISO 52120-1, EN 16798-1 and EN 17423 or superseding documents. This 
provision shall not constitute a lega l codifi cation of those standards.
Member States shall take the necessar y measures to ensure that, where buildings are supplied by distr ict heating or 
cooling syste ms, the benefits of such supply are recognised and accounted for in the calculation methodology , in 
particular the renewable energy share, through individually certified or recognised primar y energy factors.
2.The energy needs and energy use for space heating, space cooling, domestic hot wate r, ventilation, lighting and other 
technical building syste ms shall be calculated using monthly , hourly or sub-hourly time calculation intervals in order to 
account for varying conditions that significantly affect the operation and perf ormance of the system and the indoor 
conditions, and to opti mise health, indoor air quality , including comf ort levels, defined by Member States at national or 
regional level.
Where product-specif ic regulations for energy-relat ed products adopt ed under Directive 2009/125/EC include specif ic 
product information requirements for the purpose of calculating energy perfo rmance and life-cy cle GWP under this 
Directive, national calculation methods shall not require additional information.
The calculation of primar y energy shall be based on regularly update d and forward-looking primar y energy factor s 
(distinguishing non-renewable, renewable and total) or weighting factors per energy carrier, which have to be recognised 
by the national author ities and taking into account the expecte d energy mix on the basis of its national energy and 
climate plan. Those primar y energy factors or weighting factor s may be based on national, regional or local information. 
Primar y energy factor s or weighting factors may be set on an annual, seasonal, monthly , daily or hourly basis or on more 
specific information made available for individual distr ict syste ms.EN OJ L, 8.5.2024
48/68 ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2024/1275/ojPrimar y energy factor s or weighting factors shall be defined by Member States. The choices made and data sources shall 
be repor ted according to EN 17423 or any superseding document. Member States may opt for an average Union 
primar y energy factor for electr icity established pursuant to Directive (EU) 2023/1791 instead of a primar y energy factor 
reflecting the electr icity mix in the countr y.
3.For the purpose of expressing the energy perf ormance of a building, Member States shall define additional numer ic 
indicator s of total, non-renewable and renewable primar y energy use, and of operational greenhouse gas emissions 
produced in kgC O2eq/(m2.y).
4.The methodology shall be laid down taking into consideration at least the follo wing aspects:
(a)the following actual ther mal character istics of the building including its internal partitions:
(i)ther mal capacity ;
(ii)insulation;
(iii) passive heating;
(iv) cooling elements;
(v)ther mal bridges;
(b)heating installation and domestic hot-wat er supply , including their insulation character istics;
(c)capacity of installed on-sit e renewable energy generation and energy storage ;
(d)air-conditioning installations;
(e)natural and mechanica l ventilation which may include air-tightness and heat reco very;
(f)built-in lighting installation (mainly in the non-residential sector);
(g)the design, positioning and orientation of the building, including outdoor climate;
(h)passive solar syste ms and solar prot ection;
(i)indoor climatic conditions, including the designed indoor climate;
(j)inter nal loads;
(k)building automation and control syste ms and their capabilities to monito r, control and optimise energy 
perfo rmance.
5.The positive influence of the follo wing aspects shall be take n into account:
(a)local solar exposure conditions, active solar systems and other heating and electr icity systems on the basis of energy 
from renewable sources;
(b)electr icity produced by coge neration;
(c)distr ict or block heating and cooling syste ms;
(d)natural lighting;
(e)electr ical storage syste ms;
(f)ther mal storag e systems.
6.For the purposes of the calculation of the energy perfor mance of buildings, buildings should be adequately classif ied into 
the following catego ries:

Common general framew ork for rating the smar t readiness of buildings
1.The Commission shall establish the definition of the smar t readiness indicator and a methodology by which it is to be 
calculated, in order to assess the capabilities of a building or building unit to adap t its operation to the needs of the 
occupant and of the grid and to improve its energy efficiency and overall perform ance.
The smar t readiness indicator shall cover features for enhanced energy savings, benchmarking and flexibility , enhanced 
functionalities and capabilities resulting from more interconnected and intellig ent devices.
The methodology shall take into account features such as the possible existe nce of a digital twin of the building.
The methodology shall take into account features such as smar t meters, building automat ion and control systems, 
self-regulating devices for the regulation of indoor air temperature, built-in home appliances, recharging points for 
electr ic vehicles, energy storage and detailed functionalities and the interoperability of those features, as well as benef its 
for the indoor climate conditions, energy efficiency , perf ormance levels and enabled flexibility .
2.The methodology shall rely on the follo wing key functionalities relating to the building and its technical building 
syste ms:
(a)the ability to maintain energy perf ormance and operation of the building through the adap tation of energy 
consump tion for exam ple through use of energy from renewable sources;
(b)the ability to adap t its operation mode in response to the needs of the occupant while paying due attention to the 
availability of user -friendliness, maintaining health y indoor climate conditions and the ability to repor t on energy 
use;
(c)the flexibility of a building’s overall energy demand, including its ability to enable participation in active and passive 
as well as imp licit and explicit demand response, through its energy storage and release of energy back to the grid, 
for exam ple through flexibility and load shifting capacities; and
(d)the ability to improve its energy efficiency and overal l perf ormance through the use of energy-sa ving technologies.
3.The methodology may further take into account:
(a)the interop erability between syste ms (smar t meter s, building automation and control syste ms, built-in home 
appliances, self-regulating devices for the regulation of indoor air temperature within the building and indoor air 
quality sensors and ventilations); and
(b)the positive influence of existing communication netwo rks, in particular the existe nce of high-speed-ready 
in-building physica l infrastr ucture, such as the voluntary ‘broadband ready’ label, and the exist ence of an access point 
for buildings with multiple residential building units, in accordance with Article 8 of Directive 2014/61/EU of the 
European Parliament and of the Council (1).
4.The methodology shall not negatively affect existing national energy perfo rmance certification sche mes and shall build 
on related initiatives at national level, while taking into account the principle of occupant ownership, data protect ion, 
privacy and secur ity, in compliance with relevant Union data prot ection and privacy law as well as best available 
techniques for cyber secur ity.
5.The methodology shall set out the most appropr iate format of the smar t readiness indicator paramet er and shall be 
simple, transparent, and easily understandable for consumers, owner s, invest ors and demand-response marke t 
participants.EN OJ L, 8.5.2024

Comparativ e methodology framew ork to identify cost-optimal levels of energy perfor mance requirements for 
buildings and building elements
The com parative methodology framew ork shall enable Member States to determine the energy and emission perf ormance 
of buildings and building elements and the economic aspects of measures relating to the energy and emission perform ance, 
and to link them with a view to identifying the cost-optimal level to achi eve the 2030 emission reduction and climat e 
neutrality goals, as well as a zero-emission building stock by 2050 at the latest.
The comp arative methodology framew ork shall be accom panied by guidelines outlining how to apply that framew ork in 
the calculation of cost-optim al perfo rmance levels.
The comp arative methodology framew ork shall allow for taking into account use patterns , outdoor climate conditions and 
their future chang es according to best availa ble climat e projections, including heat and cold waves, investment costs, 
building categor y, mainte nance and operating costs (including energy costs and savings), earnings from energy produced, 
where applicable, envir onmental and health exte rnalities of energy use, waste management costs, where applicable, and 
technological developments. It should be based on relevant European standards relating to this Directive.
The Commission shall also provide:
—guidelines to accom pany the comparative methodology framew ork; those guidelines will serve to enable the Member 
States to under take the steps listed below ,
—information on estimat ed long-term energy price developments.
For the application of the comparative methodology framework by Member States, general conditions, expressed by 
parameter s, shall be laid down at Member State level. The Commission shall issue recommendations to Member States 
regard ing their cost optimality levels, where relevant.
The comp arative methodology framew ork shall require Member States to:
—define reference buildings that are character ised by and representative of their functionality and geographic location, 
including indoor and outdoor climate conditions. The reference buildings shall cover residential and non-residential 
buildings, both new and existing ones,
—define energy efficiency measures to be assessed for the reference buildings. Those may be measures for individual 
buildings as a whole, for individual building elements, or for a combination of building elements,
—assess the final and primar y energy need and resulting emissions of the reference buildings with the defined energy 
efficiency measures applied,
—calculate the costs (i.e. the net present value) of the energy efficiency measures (as refer red to in the second indent) 
during the expecte d economic life cycle applied to the reference buildings (as referred to in the first indent) by applying 
the comparative methodology framework principles.
By calculating the costs of the energy efficiency measures during the expecte d economic life cycle, the cost-eff ectiveness of 
diffe rent levels of minimum energy performance requirements is assessed by the Member States. That will allow the 
determinat ion of cost-optim al levels of energy perfor mance requirements. OJ L, 8.5.2024 EN

of 14 March 2024
on the first phase of the establishment of a common Union rating scheme for data centres 
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive (EU) 2023/1791 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 September 2023 on 
energy efficiency and amending Regulation (EU) 2023/955 (1), in particular Article 33(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive (EU) 2023/1791 addresses energy efficiency by setting energy efficiency targets at Union level and 
establishing a common framework of measures to promote energy efficiency within the Union. Moreover Directive 
(EU) 2023/1791 aims to contribute towards achieving a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy in the 
Union, including by the establishment of a common Union scheme for rating the sustainability of data centres.
(2) The Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector is increasingly important in terms of energy 
consumption. The electricity demand of data centres is expected to be at 3,2 % of the EU total by 2030, a 28 % 
increase since 2018 (2). The Union’s Digital Strategy (3)highlighted the need for highly energy-efficient and 
sustainable data centres and called for transparency measures for telecommunication operators on their 
environmental footprint.
(3) Pursuant to Article 12 of Directive (EU) 2023/1791, Member States are to require owners and operators of data 
centres to make publicly available the information regarding their data centres set out in Annex VII to that Directive.
(4) The common Union scheme should set out the key performance indicators and the methodology to measure them 
and should establish data centre sustainability indicators on the basis of these information and key performance 
indicators.
(5) Existing legislation, initiatives and standards in the data centres sector should be taken into account when 
establishing the key performance indicators and the sustainability indicators.
(6) This Regulation defines that the data centre operators are the reporting entities. A data centre operator should make 
public and communicate to the European database the required information and key performance indicators for a 
data centre regardless of whether this data centre consists of one structure or a group of structures. A data centre 
operator should make public and communicate to the European database a separate set of information and key 
performance indicators for every data centre that has a different physical location even if these data centres are 
located in the territory of the same Member State.

(3) Decision (EU) 2022/2481 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2022 establishing the Digital Decade Policy 
Programme 2030 (OJ L 323, 19.12.2022, p. 4, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dec/2022/2481/oj).(7) A data centre park or campus is understood as a facility that houses more than one data centre. In this case, the 
operator of each data centre should make public and communicate to the European database a separate set of 
information and key performance indicators for every data centre in the facility.
(8) In order to establish the Union scheme for rating the sustainability of data centres, it is necessary to collect data on 
their sustainability. Therefore, a reporting mechanism for data centres should be established specifying what 
information and key performance indicators should be reported as well as the methodologies for monitoring and 
measuring that information and those indicators.
(9) Pursuant to Annex VII, point (c), to Directive (EU) 2023/1791, the key performance indicators are to measure the 
energy consumption, power utilisation, temperature set points, waste heat utilisation, water usage and use of 
renewable energy of data centres.
(10) To ensure uniform reporting, and the availability of the reported data to the public in an aggregated form, and to 
properly inform the subsequent analysis of the data, the Commission is to establish, a European database on data 
centres, in accordance with Article 12(3) of Directive (EU) 2023/1791. For data centres to communicate the 
information and key performance indicators to the European database, the latter should provide for a common user 
interface as well as a common application programming interface.
(11) Reporting data centres should ensure that the information and key performance indicators set out in the annexes to 
this delegated regulation are inserted in the European database on data centres. The information and key 
performance indicators should be used to provide a basis for transparent and evidence-based planning and decision 
making by Member States and the Commission, and to assess certain key elements of a sustainable data centre, 
including how efficiently it uses energy, how much of that energy comes from renewable energy sources, the reuse 
of any waste heat that it produces, the effectiveness of cooling and the use of water. To this end, a first set of data 
centre sustainability indicators should set out, based on the reported information and key performance indicators.
(12) Pursuant to Article 12(1) of Directive (EU) 2023/1791, the information of data centres subject to Union and national 
law protecting trade and business secrets and confidentiality must not be made publicly available. Article 12(3) also 
requires that the European database be publicly available on an aggregated level. Thus, it is necessary to ensure that 
the key performance indicators and other information reported to the European database are kept confidential.
(13) The Commission carried out a study, particularly on the necessity of a reporting scheme on the energy performance 
and sustainability of data centres, in order to establish the common Union rating system, which identified the main 
elements that should define the scope of reporting on the energy performance and sustainability of data centres.
(14) The Commission has consulted relevant stakeholders and Member States representatives and gathered evidence, 
remarks and good practices on the scope, elements, information and key performance indicators that should be 
included in the common Union rating scheme.
(15) The Commission has consulted the experts designated by each Member State in accordance with Article 34 of 
Directive (EU) 2023/1791, and gathered observations on the scope, elements, information and key performance 
indicators that should be included in the common Union rating scheme,EN OJ L, 17.5.2024

KEY PERFORMANCE INDIC ATORS TO BE MONITORED, GATHERED AND COMMUNIC ATED TO THE 
EUROPEAN DATABASE ON DATA CENTRES AND THE MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGIES
For all monitoring, data centre operators shall keep a record of the measurement points and measurement devices used, for 
a period of at least 10 years.
The following key performance indicators shall be monitored, gathered and communicated to the European database on 
data centres.
1. Energy and sustainability indicators
(a) Installed information technology power demand (‘PD IT’, in kW), as defined in Article 2. Where the installed 
information technology power demand has changed during the reporting period, a weighted average shall be 
used.
Where the installed information technology power demand cannot be determined, the data centre rated 
information technology power demand (in kW), as defined in Article 2, can be used. Where the data centre 
rated information technology power demand has changed during the reporting period, a weighted average shall 
be used.
The reporting data centre shall indicate which metric it uses for its reporting;
(b) Data centre total floor area (‘SDC’, in square metres).
If the structure that houses the data centre has a different primary function (for example, office building), the 
value of SDC must be limited to the sum of the floor area occupied by the data centre’s computer room or 
rooms and the floor area occupied by the equipment necessary for the proper operation of the data centre.
If this equipment also serves the other functions of the structure (for example, common cooling system for the 
whole structure), a percentage of the floor area occupied by such equipment that reflects the rated power 
demand of the data centre computer room or rooms shall be used for the calculation of the previous 
subparagraph.
If the data centre occupies one structure, the value of SDC shall be the floor area of this structure.
If the data centre occupies a group of structures, the value of SDC shall be the sum of the floor areas of all 
structures;
(c) Data centre computer room floor area (‘SCR’, in square metres).
If the data centre occupies a group of structures, the value of SCR shall be the sum of the computer room floor 
area of all structures;
(d) Total energy consumption (‘EDC’, in kWh) of the reporting data centre shall be measured as defined by, and by using 
the methodology in the CEN/CENELEC EN 50600-4-2 standard or equivalent.
Total energy consumption includes the use of electricity, fuels and other energy sources used for cooling.
The amount of EDC coming from back-up generators (EDC-BG , in kWh) shall be measured separately.
Total energy consumption shall be measured at the input of the data centre system before the supply transfer 
switchgear. The measurement points shall be set at the primary and secondary supply of energy and at every 
additional supply, for example, back-up generation.EN OJ L, 17.5.2024 
8/17 ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2024/1364/ojIn the case of a cogeneration or an absorption chiller, if internal to the system, the measurement point shall be at 
the input of the cogeneration or absorption chiller, measuring the fuel consumed. If external, in the case of 
cogeneration, the measurement points shall be at the electricity and heat outputs, and in the case of the 
absorption chiller, the measurement point shall be at the cooling output;
(e) Total energy consumption of information technology equipment (‘EIT’, in kWh) shall be measured in accordance with 
the category 1 methodology for the calculation of the PUE set out in the CEN/CENELEC EN 50600-4-2 
standard or equivalent. Data centres shall measure the combined annual energy consumption at every 
uninter ruptible power system (UPS) connected to data centre information technology equipment.
For data centres that do not have a UPS, for example, direct current data centres, EIT can be measured at the 
power distribution unit (PDU) connected to data centre information technology equipment, or in accordance 
with the category 2 methodology for the calculation of the PUE set out in the CEN/CENELEC EN 50600-4-2 
standard, or at a measurement point that data centres will specify.
Figure 1 illustrates a general schema of monitoring and measurement points in a data centre, where 
measurement locations for the total energy consumption and the total consumption of information technology 
equipment are indicated;
Figure 1
Measurement of energy consumption
(f) Electrical grid functions is the information on whether any functions that support the stability, reliability, and 
resilience of the electrical grid are provided by the data centre, such as peak demand shifting or firm frequency 
response (FFR);
(g) Average battery capacity (‘C BtG’, in kW) is the average capacity of the data centre batteries that were offered to the 
grid via a relevant market or contracts for electrical grid functions;
(h) Total water input (‘W IN’, in cubic metres) shall be measured as defined by, and by using the methodology set out in 
the CEN/CENELEC EN 50600-4-9 standard WUE Category 2, or if not possible, the methodology set out in 
Category 1, or equivalent standard. Data centres shall measure all water volumes that enter the data centre 
boundary and are used in relation to the data centre functions including environmental, power, security, and 
information technology.OJ L, 17.5.2024 EN 
ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2024/1364/oj 9/17The reporting data centre shall indicate which WUE Category it uses for its reporting.
Figure 2 illustrates a general schema of monitoring and measurement points in a data centre, including 
measurement locations for ERES-OS , WIN, and EREUSE ;
Figure 2
Measurement of water input and waste heat reused.
(i) Total potable water input (‘W IN-POT ’, in cubic metres) shall be measured as defined by, and by using the 
methodology set out in, the CEN/CENELEC EN 50600-4-9 standard WUE Category 1 or equivalent. Data 
centres shall measure all potable water sources that enter the data centre boundary and are used for data centre 
functions including environmental, power, security, and information technology;
If the structure that houses the data centre has a different primary function, the values of WIN and WIN-POT must 
be limited to the water used (or estimated as used) by the equipment in the data centre’s computer room or 
rooms and the equipment necessary for the operation of the data centre.
(j) Waste heat reused (‘EREUSE ’, in kWh) shall be measured as defined by, and by using the methodology set out in, 
the CEN/CENELEC EN 50600-4-6 standard or equivalent. Data centres shall measure the heat that is used or 
reused outside of the data centre boundar y, and which substitutes partly or totally energy needed outside the 
data centre boundar y.
Defining the boundaries of the data centre is a key aspect to successfully measure this indicator, since only 
energy being reused outside the boundaries of the data centre is counted. Figure 2 provides a scheme to set the 
data centre boundaries, which are described by the perimeter, spaces and equipment contained therein.
Reused energy shall be measured at the boundary of the data centre at the point where the energy provided is 
handed off to be used by the other party.EN OJ L, 17.5.2024 
10/17 ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2024/1364/ojIf part of the waste heat is reused for cooling the data centre, that part must be subtracted from the reused waste 
heat, that is to say, subtracting the share of flow rate of cooling fluid used in the data centre;
(k) Average waste heat temperature (‘T WH’, in degree Celsius) shall be measured as the temperature of the fluid used to 
cool the information and communication technology equipment in the data centre computer room, averaged 
over the year, and across every measurement point.
The waste heat temperature is measured at the point where the heated fluid enters the heat exchanger(s) at the 
data centre computer room boundary (Figure 3). For data centres with heat recovery, that is at the heat 
recovery exchanger. If there is no heat recover y, the measurement is taken at every heat exchanger at the data 
centre computer room boundary carrying heat from the information technology equipment;
Figure 3
Measurement of waste heat temperature
(l) Average setpoint information technology equipment intake air temperature (‘T IN’, in degree Celsius) shall be measured as 
the average setpoint temperature in all data centre computer rooms, set as a setpoint command to the cooling 
system used for the information and communication technology equipment in the data centre computer rooms 
averaged over the year.OJ L, 17.5.2024 EN

area, where each type of refrigerant is the common name or industrial designation of the refrigerant in 
accordance with the Annexes to the Regulation (EU) No 517/2014 of the European Parliament and of the 
Council (1);
(n) Cooling degree days (‘CDD’, in degree-days) shall be determined as the number of cooling degree days for the 
location of the reporting data centre during the last calendar year, by using the methodology used by Eurostat 
and the Joint Research Centre (2)or equivalent (3), and with a base temperature of 21 degrees Celsius. Open 
access sources shall be used to determine the cooling degree days;
(o) Total renewable energy consumption (‘ERES-TOT ’, in kWh) shall be determined as defined by, and by using the 
methodology set out in the CEN/CENELEC EN 50600-4-3 standard or equivalent. ERES-TOT is the sum of ERES- 
GOO, ERES-PPA and ERES-OS , as defined below;
(p) Total renewable energy consumption from Guarantees of Origin (‘ERES-GOO ’, in kWh) shall be determined as the sum of 
the Guarantees of Origin purchased and retired by the reporting data centre. The data centre shall measure the 
ERES-PPA that enters the data centre boundar y, and which cannot be counted for more than one data centre or be 
created from power purchasing agreements or on-site renewables;
(q) Total renewable energy consumption from Power Purchasing Agreements (‘ERES-PP A’, in kWh) shall be determined as the 
amount of energy from Power Purchasing Agreements made by the reporting data centre. The data centre shall 
measure the ERES-PPA that enters the data centre boundar y, and which cannot be counted for more than one data 
centre.
Any Guarantees of Origin created as a result of such Power Purchasing Agreements must be owned and retired 
by the reporting data centre so that they are included in ERES-PP A. Otherwise, the concerned amount of energy 
shall be subtracted from the measured ERES-PP A;
(r) Total renewable energy consumption from on-site renewables (‘ERES-OS ’, in kWh) shall be measured as the energy 
generated from on-site renewable energy sources within the data centre boundar y. See Figure 2.
Any Guarantees of Origin created as a result of these on-site renewable energy sources must be owned and 
retired by the reporting data centre so that they are included in ERES-OS . Otherwise, the amount of energy in 
question shall be subtracted from the measured ERES-OS .EN OJ L, 17.5.2024

ICT capacity is measured for servers and data storage products as servers and data storage products are defined in the 
Commission Regulation (EU) 2019/424 (4). ICT capacity indicators shall be reported for the respective equipment in 
place as of 31 December of the reporting year.
(a) ICT capacity for servers (‘C SER V’) shall be the sum of the SERT active state performance or equivalent for all servers. 
Server ICT capacity is the active state performance rating as declared in the manufacturer information in 
accordance with Commission Regulation (EU) 2019/424. The active state performance value for the 
configured server or group of servers in a data centre computer room shall be either interpolated from the 
declared active state performance value for a configuration declared under the Regulation (EU) 2019/424, or 
provided by a server manufacturer, or provided by a table of values for CPU part numbers created from a large 
SERT dataset, or estimated from a large dataset of measured values where a recognised calculation method 
exists.. Where there is no recognised calculation methodology, the performance of the declared configuration 
most closely matching the configured server shall be used. When a server is upgraded, its new capacity shall be 
recalculated if a recognised methodology for estimating the SERT active state performance exists.
ICT capacity for servers shall be reported, as a minimum, for all new servers installed in the reporting data centre 
after the date of the entry into force of this Delegated Regulation. Data centre operators shall estimate and 
indicate the percentage of the data centre computer room floor area that the reported indicator covers.
Colocation data centre operators may calculate CSERV by extrapolating the value that corresponds to at least 
90 % of the installed information technology power demand of all new servers installed in the reporting data 
centre, as referred to in the previous subparagraph.
(b) ICT capacity for storage equipment (‘C STOR ’, in petabytes) shall be the storage capacity, namely the sum of the raw 
(addressable) capacity of all SSD and HDD storage devices installed in all the storage equipment as declared by 
the storage device manufacturer.
ICT capacity for storage equipment shall be reported, as a minimum, for all new devices installed in the 
reporting data centre after the date of the entry into force of this Delegated Regulation. Data centre operators 
shall estimate and indicate the percentage of the data centre computer room floor area that the reported 
indicator covers.
Colocation data centre operators may calculate CSTOR by extrapolating the value that corresponds to at least 
90 % of the installed information technology power demand of all new storage equipment installed in the 
reporting data centre, as referred to in the previous subparagraph.
3. Data traf fic indicators

Whereas:
(1) In the cont ext of the European Green Deal, set out in the communication from the Commission of 11 December 
2019 (the ‘European Green Deal’), Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4)
established the objective of climat e neutrality in the Union by 2050 and an intermediate target of a reduction of net 
greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 % compare d to 1990 levels by 2030. The Union’s climat e neutrality 
objective requires a just energy transition which leav es no territory or citizen behind, an increase in energy 
efficiency and signif icantly higher shares of energy from renewable sources in an integrat ed energy syste m.
(2) Renewable energy plays a fundamental role in achieving those objectives, given that the energy sector currently 
contr ibut es over 75 % of total greenhouse gas emissions in the Union. By reducing those greenhouse gas emissions, 
renewable energy can also contr ibute to tackli ng challeng es related to the environment, such as the loss of 
biodiversity , and to reducing pollution in line with the objectives of the Commission communication of 12 May 
2021 , entitled ‘Pathwa y to a Healthy Planet for All EU Action Plan: “Towards Zero Pollution for Air, Water and 
Soil”’ . The green transition to a renewable energy based economy will help to achieve the objectives of Decision 
(EU) 2022/591 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5), whic h also aims to protect, restore and impro ve 
the state of the environment by, inter alia, halting and reversing biodiversity loss. The fact that renewable energy 
reduces exposure to price shocks compare d to fossil fuels can give renewable energy a key role in tackling energy 
poverty. Renewable energy can also bring broad socioeconomic benefi ts, creating new jobs and fosteri ng local 
industr ies while addressing growing domestic and global demand for renewable energy technology .

2023/2413  31.10.2023ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2023/2413/oj 2/77(3) Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6)sets a binding overall Union targe t to 
reach a share of at least 32 % of energy from renewable sources in the Union’s gross final consump tion of energy by 
2030. Unde r the 2030 Climat e Target Plan, set out in the Commission communication of 17 Sept ember 2020 , 
entitled ‘Stepping up Europe’s 2030 climate ambition: Investing in a climat e-neutral future for the benefit of our 
people’, the share of renewable energy in gross final consump tion of energy would need to increase to 40 % by 
2030 in order to achi eve the Union’s greenhouse gas emissions reduction targe t. In that context, in July 2021, as 
part of the packag e deliver ing on the European Green Deal, the Commission proposed to double the share of 
renewable energy in the energy mix by 2030, compar ed to 2020, to reach at least 40 %.
(4) The general context created by Russia’s inva sion of Ukraine and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a 
surge in energy prices across the Union, thus highlighting the need to accelerat e energy efficiency and increase the 
use of renewable energy in the Union. In order to achieve the long-t erm objective of an energy system that is 
independent of third countr ies, the Union should focus on accelerating the green transition and ensur ing an 
emission-reducing energy policy that reduces dependence on imported fossil fuels and that promotes fair and 
affordable prices for Union citizens and under takings in all sectors of the econom y.
(5) The REP owerEU Plan set out in the Commission communication of 18 May 2022 (the ‘REP owerEU Plan’) aims to 
make the Union independent from Russian fossil fuels well before 2030. That communication provid es for the 
front-loading of wind and solar energy , increasing the averag e deplo yment rate of such energy as well as for 
additional renewable energy capacity by 2030 to accommodate the higher production of renewable fuels of non- 
biological origin. It also invit ed the co-legislator s to consider establishing a higher or earlier target for the increased 
share of renewable energy in the energy mix. In that context, it is appropr iate to increase the overall Union 
renewable energy target to 42,5 % in order to signif icantly accelerat e the current pace of deplo yment of renewable 
energy , thereby accelerating the phase-out of the Union’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels by increasing the 
availability of affordable, secure and sustainable energy in the Union. Beyond that mandatory level, Member States 
should endeav our to collectively achieve an overall Union renewable energy target of 45 % in line with the 
REP owerEU Plan.
(6) The renewable energy targe ts should go hand-in-hand with the compl ementar y decarbonisation efforts on the basis 
of other non-f ossil energy sources towards reach ing climate neutrality by 2050. Member States should be able to 
combine different non-f ossil energy sources in order to achi eve the objective of the Union to become climate 
neutral by 2050, taking into account their specif ic national circumstances and the structure of their energy supply . 
In order to achi eve that objective, the deplo yment of renewable energy in the framewor k of the increased binding 
overall Union target should be integrat ed into complementary decarbonisation efforts involving the development of 
other non-f ossil energy sources that Member States decide to pursue.
(7) Innovatio n is key to the competitiveness of renewable energy . The European Strategic Energy Technology Plan set 
out in the Commission communication of 15 Sept ember 2015 , entitled ‘Towards an Integrated Strategic Energy 
Techn ology (SET) Plan: Accelerating the European Energy System Transf ormation (the ‘SET -Plan’) aims to boost the 
transition towards a climate neutral energy syste m through actions for research and innovati on, which address the 
whole innovati on chain, from research to mark et uptak e. In their integrated national energy and climat e plans 
submitted pursuant to Article 3 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7), 
Member States set national objectives and funding target s for public and, where available, private researc h and 
innovati on relating to the Energy Union, including, where appropr iate, a timeframe for when the objectives should 
be met ; reflecting the priorities of the Energy Union Strategy set out in the Commission communication of 
25 Febr uary 2015 , entitled, ‘A Framew ork Strategy for a Resilient Energy Union with a Forward-Looking Climate 
(6)Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the promotion of the use of energy 
from renewable sources (OJ L 328, 21.12.2018, p. 82).
(7)Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the Governa nce of the Energy 
Union and Climate Action, amending Regulations (EC) No 663/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 of the European Parliament and of the 
Council, Directives 94/22/EC, 98/70/EC, 2009/31/EC, 2009/73/EC, 2010/31/EU, 2012/27/EU and 2013/30/EU of the European 
Parliament and of the Council, Council Directives 2009/119/EC and (EU) 2015/652 and repealing Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of 
the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 328, 21.12.2018, p. 1).OJ L, 31.10.2023 EN  ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2023/2413/oj 3/77Change Policy’, and, where relevant, of the SET-Plan. To compl ement their national objectives and funding target s, to 
promote the production of renewable energy from inno vative renewable energy technology and to safeg uard the 
continued leadership of the Union in research and development of inno vative renewable energy technology , each 
Member State should set an indicative targe t for innovative renewable energy technology of at least 5 % of newly 
installed renewable energy capacity by 2030.
(8) In accordance with Article 3 of Directive (EU) 2023/1791 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8)and in 
line with Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/1749 (9), Member States should take an integrat ed approac h by 
promoting the most energy efficient renewable source for any given sector and application, as well as by promoting 
system efficiency , so that the least energy is required for any given economic activity .
(9) The amendments set out in this Directive are also intende d to suppor t the achieve ment of the Union’s target of an 
annual production of sustainable biomethane of 35 billion cubic meters by 2030, set out in the Commission staff 
working document of 18 May 2022 accompan ying the REP owerEU Plan, entitled ‘Implementing the Repowe r EU 
Action Plan: Investment needs, hydrog en accelerator and achieving the bio-methane targets’, thereby suppor ting 
secur ity of supply and the Union’s climat e ambitions.
(10) There is growing recognition of the need to align bioenergy policies with the principle of the cascading use of biomass. 
That principle aims to achieve the resource efficien cy of biomass use by prioritising, wherever possible, the material use 
of biomass over its energy use, thus increasing the amount of biomass available within the system. Such an alignment is 
intended to ensure fair access to the biomass raw material market for the development of innovative, high value-added 
bio-based solutions and a sustainable circular bioeconomy . When developing suppor t schemes for bioenergy , Member 
States should theref ore take into consideration the available supply of sustainable biomass for energy and non-energy 
uses and the mainte nance of the national forest carbon sink s and ecosyste ms, as well as the principle of the circular 
econom y, the principle of the cascading use of biomass and the waste hierarc hy established in Directive 2008/98/EC 
of the European Parliament and of the Council (10). In line with the principle of the cascading use of biomass, woo dy 
biomass should be used according to its highest economic and environmental added value in the follow ing order of 
priorities: wood -based products, exten ding the service life of wood-based products, re-use, recy cling, bioenergy and 
disposal. Where no other use for woody biomass is economically viable or environmentally appropr iate, energy 
recovery helps to reduce energy generation from non-renewable sources. Member States’ suppor t schemes for 
bioenergy should theref ore be direct ed to such feedst ocks for which little mark et comp etition exists with the mater ial 
secto rs, and whose sourcing is considered positive for both climat e and biodiversity , in order to avoid negative 
incentives for unsustainable bioenergy pathwa ys, as identifi ed in the 2021 repor t of the Commission’s Joint Researc h 
Centre, entitled ‘The use of woody biomass for energy production in the EU’.
At the same time, in imp lementing measures ensur ing the application of the principle of the cascading use of 
biomass, it is necessar y to recognise the national specifi cities which guide Member States in the design of their 
suppor t schem es. Member States should be allowed to deroga te from that principle in duly justif ied circumstances, 
for example where required for secur ity of energy supply purposes, such as in the case of particularly severe cold 
conditions. Member States should also be allowed to derog ate from that principle where there are no industr ies or 
processing facilities that could mak e higher added value use of certain feedstoc ks within a geographical perimeter . 
In such a case, transpor t beyond that perimeter for the purpose of such a use might not be justif ied from an 
economic or environmental point of view . Member States should notify any such derogat ions to the Commission. 
Member States should not grant direct financial suppor t for the production of energy from saw logs, veneer logs, 
industr ial grade roundwoo d, stumps and roots. For the purpose of this Directive, tax benefi ts are not considered to 
(8)Directive (EU) 2023/1791 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 Sept ember 2023 on energy efficiency and amending 
Regulation (EU) 2023/955 (OJ L 231, 20.9.2023, p. 1).
(9)Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/1749 of 28 September 2021 on Energy Efficiency First: from principles to practice – 
Guidelines and examples for its implement ation in decision-making in the energy sector and beyond (OJ L 350, 4.10.2021, p. 9).
(10)Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 on wast e and repealing certain Directives 
(OJ L 312, 22.11.2008, p. 3).OJ L, 31.10.2023 EN  ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2023/2413/oj 4/77be direct financial suppor t. Waste prevention, reuse and recy cling of wast e should be the priority option. Member 
State s should avoid creating suppor t sche mes which would be count er to targets on treatment of waste and which 
would lead to the ineffi cient use of recy clable waste. Moreover , in order to ensure more efficient use of bioenergy , 
Member State s should not grant new suppor t or renew any suppor t for electr icity-only plants, unless the 
installations are locat ed in regions with a specifi c use status as regards their transition awa y from fossil fuels or in 
the outermost regions referred to in Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), or 
the installations use carbon captur e and storag e.
(11) The rapid growth and increasing cost-competitiveness of renewable electr icity production can be used to satisfy a 
growing share of the demand for energy , for instance using heat pum ps for space heating or low-temperature 
industr ial processes, electr ic vehicles for transpor t, or electr ic furnaces in certain industr ies. Renewable electr icity 
can also be used to produce synthetic fuels for consump tion in hard-to -decarbonise transpor t sectors such as 
aviation and mar itime transpor t. A framewor k for electr ification needs to enable robust and efficient coordination 
and expand mark et mecha nisms to match both supply and demand in space and time, stimulate investments in 
flexibility , and help integrat e large shares of variable renewable energy generation. Member States should theref ore 
ensure that the deplo yment of renewable electr icity continues to increase at an adequate pace to meet growin g 
demand. To that end, Member State s should establish a framewor k that includes mark et-compatible mechanisms to 
tackle the remaining barriers to having secure and adequat e electr icity systems fit for a high level of renewable 
energy , as well as storage facilities fully integrat ed into the electr icity system . In particular , that framewor k should 
tackle the remaining barriers, including non-fi nancial ones such as the lack, on the part of author ities, of sufficient 
digital and human resources to process a growing number of permit applications.
(12) When calculating the share of renewable energy in a Member State , renewable fuels of non-biological origin should 
be counted in the sector where they are consumed (electr icity , heating and cooling, or transpor t). To avoid double- 
counting, the renewable electr icity used to produce those fuels should not be counted. That would result in a 
harmonisation of the accounting rules for those fuels throughout Directive (EU) 2018/2001, regardl ess of whether 
they are counted for the overall renewable energy target or for any sub-target. It would also allow the real energy 
consumed to be counted, taking account of energy losses in the process to produce those fuels. Moreover , it would 
allow renewable fuels of non-biological origin imported into and consumed in the Union to be counte d. Member 
State s should be allowed to agree, via a specifi c cooperation agreement, to count the renewable fuels of non- 
biological origin consumed in a given Member State towards the share of gross final consump tion of energy from 
renewable sources in the Member State where they were produced. Where such cooperation agreements are put in 
place, unless agreed other wise, Member States are encourag ed to count the renewable fuels of non-biological origin 
that are produced in a Member State other than the Member States where they are consumed as follows: up to 70 % 
of their volume in the countr y where they are consumed and up to 30 % of their volume in the countr y where they 
are produced. Agreements between Member States can take the form of a specific cooperation agreement made via 
the Union’s renewable development platf orm, launc hed on 29 November 2021 .
(13) Cooperation between Member States to promot e renewable energy can take the form of statistical transfer s, suppor t 
schem es or joint projects. It allows for a cost-efficient deplo yment of renewable energy across Europe and 
contr ibut es to mark et integration. Despite its pote ntial, cooperation between Member States has been very limit ed, 
thus leading to subopt imal results in term s of efficiency in increasing renewable energy . Member States should 
theref ore be oblig ed to establish a framework for cooperation on joint projects by 2025. Within such a framework, 
Member States should endea vour to establish at least two joint projects by 2030. In addition, Member States whose 
annual consum ption of electr icity excee ds 100 TWh should endea vour to establish a third joint project by 2033. 
Projects financed by national contr ibutions under the Union renewable energy financing mech anism established by 
Commission Imple menting Regulation (EU) 2020/1294 (11)would meet that oblig ation for the Member States 
involved.
(11)Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1294 of 15 Sept ember 2020 on the Union renewable energy financing mechanism 
(OJ L 303, 17.9.2020, p. 1).OJ L, 31.10.2023 EN  ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2023/2413/oj 5/77(14) In its Communication of 19 November 2020 , entitled ‘An EU Strategy to harness the potential of offshore renewable 
energy for a climat e neutral future’, the Commission introduced an ambitious objective of 300 GW of offshore wind 
and 40 GW of ocean energy across all the Union’s sea basins by 2050. To ensure that step chang e, Member States 
will need to work together across borders at sea-basin level. Regulation (EU) 2022/869 of the European Parliament 
and of the Council (12)requires the Member States to conclude non-binding agreements to cooperat e on goals for 
offshore renewable energy generation to be deplo yed within each sea basin by 2050, with intermediate steps 
in 2030 and 2040. Publishing information on the volumes of offshore renewable energy that the Member States 
intend to achieve through tenders increases transparency and predictability for investors and suppor ts the 
achi evement of the goals for offshore renewable energy generation. Mar itime spatial planning is an essential tool to 
ensure the coexistence of differ ent uses of the sea. Allocating space for offshore renewable energy projects in 
mar itime spatial plans is needed to enable long-term planning, to assess the impact of those offshore renewable 
energy projects and to ensure public acceptance of their planned deplo yment. Enabling the participation of 
renewable energy communities in joint projects on offshore renewable energy provides a further means by whic h to 
enhance public acceptance.
(15) The mark et for renewables power purchase agreements is rapidly growing and provides a compl ementar y route to 
the market of renewable generation in addition to suppor t schem es by Member States or to selling directly on the 
wholesale electr icity mark et. At the same time, the mark et for renewables power purchase agreements is still limite d 
to a small number of Member States and large under takings, with signif icant administrative, technical and financial 
barriers remaining in large parts of the Union’s mark et. The existing measures provi ded for in Article 15 of 
Directive (EU) 2018/2001 to encourag e the uptak e of renewables power purchas e agreements should theref ore be 
strengthened further , by explor ing the use of credit guarant ees to reduce the financial risks of such agreements, 
taking into account that those guarant ees, where public, should not crowd out private financing. In addition, 
measures in suppor t of renewables power purchase agreements should be extended to other forms of renewable 
energy purchas e agreements, including, where relevant, renewables heating and cooling purchase agreements. In 
that cont ext, the Commission should analyse the barriers to long-ter m renewable energy purchase agreements, in 
particular to the deplo yment of cross-border renewable energy purch ase agreements, and issue guidance on the 
remo val of those barriers.
(16) Further streamlining of administrative permit-granting procedures may be needed to eliminate unnecessar y 
administrative burdens for the purpose of establishing renewable energy projects and related grid infrastr ucture 
projects. Within two years of the entr y into force of this Directive and on the basis of the integrat ed national energy 
and climate progress repor ts submitted pursuant to Article 17 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, the Commission 
should consider whether additional measures are needed to further suppor t the Member State s in the 
imp lementation of the provi sions of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 regulating permit-granting procedures, including in 
view of the requirement of the contact points set up or designated pursuant to Article 16 of that Directive to ensure 
the fulfilment of the deadlines for the permit-granting procedures set out in that Directive. It should be possible for 
such additional measures to include indicative key performance indicators on, inter alia, the length of permit- 
granting procedures regarding renewable energy projects locat ed in and outside renewables acceleration areas.
(17) Buildings have a large untapped potential to contr ibute effectively to the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in 
the Union. The decarbonisation of heating and cooling in buildings through an increased share in production and 
use of renewable energy will be needed to meet the ambition provided for in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 to achi eve 
the Union objective of climat e neutrality . However , progress on the use of renewable energy for heating and cooling 
has been stagnant over the last decade, largely relying on increased use of biomass. Without the establishment of 
indicative shares of renewable energy in buildings, it will not be possible to track progress and identify bottlenecks 
in the uptak e of renewable energy . The establishment of indicative shares of renewable energy in buildings provid es 
a long-term signal to invest ors, including for the period immediate ly after 2030. Theref ore, indicative shares for the

contr ibut es to system efficiency should also be promot ed where appropr iate. For the calculation of those indicative 
shares, when determining the share of renewable electr icity taken from the grid used in buildings, Member States 
should use the averag e share of renewable electr icity supplied in their territory in the two previous years.
(18) The indicative Union share of renewable energy in the building sector to be reached by 2030 constitut es a necessar y 
minimum milestone for ensur ing the decarbonisation of the Union’s building stoc k by 2050 and compl ements the 
regulatory framework related to energy efficiency and the energy performa nce in buildings. It is key to enabling a 
seamless, cost-effective phase out of fossil fuels from buildings to ensure their replacement by renewable energy . 
The indicative share of renewable energy in the building sector compl ements the regulatory framew ork for 
buildings pursuant to Union law on the energy performa nce of buildings by ensur ing that renewable energy 
technology , appliances and infrastr uctures, including efficient distr ict heating and cooling, are suffi ciently scaled-up 
in a timely manner to replace fossil fuels in buildings and to ensure the availability of a safe and reliable renewable 
energy supply for nearly zero-energy buildings by 2030. The indicative share of renewable energy in the building 
sector also promote s renewable energy investments in long-t erm national building renovation strateg ies and plans, 
thereby enabling the achievement of the decarbonisation of buildings. Further more, the indicative share of 
renewable energy in the building sector provides an impor tant additional indicator to promote the development or 
moder nisation of efficient distr ict heating and cooling netw orks, thereby compl ementing both the indicative distr ict 
heating and cooling target under Article 24 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 and the requirement to ensure that 
renewable energy and waste heat and cold from efficient distr ict heating and cooling systems are available to help 
cover the tota l annual primar y energy use of new or renovat ed buildings. That indicative share of renewable energy 
in the building sector is also necessar y to ensure the cost-effe ctive achievement of the annual increase in renewable 
heating and cooling pursuant to Article 23 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001.
(19) Given the large energy consum ption in residential, commercial and public buildings, existing definitions provid ed 
for in Regulation (EC) No 1099/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (13)could be used in the 
calculation of the national share of energy from renewable sources in buildings as to minimise the administrative 
burden whilst ensur ing progress in realising the Union’s indicative share of renewable energy in the building sector 
by 2030.
(20) Lengthy administrative permit-granting procedures are one of the key barriers to investment in renewable energy 
projects and their related infrastr ucture. Those barriers include the complexity of the applicable rules for site 
selection and administrative author isations for such projects, the compl exity and duration of the assessment of the 
environmental impact of such projects, and related energy networks, grid-connection problems, constraints on 
adapt ing technology specifi cations during the permit-granting procedure, and staffing problems of the permit- 
granting author ities or grid operators. In order to accelerat e the pace of deplo yment of such projects it is necessar y 
to adopt rules which would simplify and shor ten permit-granting procedures, taking into account the broad public 
acceptance of the deplo yment of renewable energy .
(21) Directive (EU) 2018/2001 streamlines the administrative permit-granting procedures for renewable energy plants by 
introducing rules on the organisation and maximum duration of the administrative part of the permit-granting 
procedure for renewable energy projects, cover ing all relevant permits to build, repower and operate renewable 
energy plants, and for the connection of such plants to the grid.
(13)Regulation (EC) No 1099/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 Octo ber 2008 on energy statistics (OJ L 304, 
14.11.2008, p. 1).OJ L, 31.10.2023 EN  ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2023/2413/oj 7/77(22) A further simplification and shor tening of the administrative permit-granting procedures for renewable energy 
plants, including energy plants which combine different renewable energy sources, heat pumps , co-locat ed energy 
storag e, including power and ther mal facilities, as well as the assets necessar y for the connection of such plants, 
heat pumps and storage to the grid and to integrate renewable energy into heating and cooling netw orks in a 
coordinat ed and harmonised manner , is necessar y in order to ensure that the Union reach es its ambitious climat e 
and energy targe ts for 2030 and the objective of climate -neutrality by 2050, while taking into account the ‘do no 
harm’ principle of the European Green Deal and without prejudice to the internal division of compet ences within 
Member States.
(23) The introduction of shor ter and clear deadlines for decisions to be taken by the author ities compet ent for granting 
permits for the renewable energy installations on the basis of a compl ete application is intended to accelerat e the 
deplo yment of renewable energy projects. The time taken to build the renewable energy plants and their grid 
connections should not be count ed towards those deadlines, excep t when it coincides with other administrative 
steps in the permit-granting procedure. It is appropr iate, however , to make a distinction between projects locat ed in 
areas that are particularly suitable for the deplo yment of renewable energy projects, for which deadlines can be 
streamlined, namely renewables acceleration areas, and projects located outside such areas. The particular ities of 
offshore renewable energy projects should be taken into account when setting those deadlines.
(24) Some of the most common problems faced by renewable energy project developers relate to compl ex and length y 
administrative permit-granting and grid-connection procedures established at national or regional level and a lack 
of suffi cient staffing and technical exper tise in permitting author ities to assess the environmental impact of the 
proposed projects. Theref ore, it is appropr iate to streamline certain environmental-related aspects of the permit- 
granting procedures for renewable energy projects.
(25) Member State s should suppor t the faster deplo yment of renewable energy projects by carrying out a coordinat ed 
mapping for the deplo yment of renewable energy and related infrastr ucture in their territory in coordination with 
local and regional author ities. Member States should identify the land, surface, sub-surface and sea or inland water 
areas necessar y for the installation of renewable energy plants and relat ed infrastr ucture in order to meet at least 
their national contr ibutions towards the revised overall renewable energy targe t for 2030 set in Article 3(1) of 
Directive (EU) 2018/2001 and in suppor t of reaching the objective of climate neutrality by 2050 at the lates t, in 
accordance with Regulation (EU) 2021/1119. Member States should be allowed to use existing spatial planning 
documents for the purpose of identifying those areas. Member States should ensure that such areas reflect their 
estimate d traject ories and total planned installed capacity and should identify specifi c areas for the diffe rent types of 
renewable energy technology provided for in their integrated national energy and climate plans submitted pursuant 
to Articles 3 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. The identif ication of the required land, surface, sub-sur face, 
and sea or inland water areas should take into consideration in particular the availability of energy from renewable 
sources and the pote ntial offered by the differ ent land and sea areas for renewable energy production of the 
differ ent types of technology , the projected demand for energy , taking into account energy and system efficiency , 
overall and in the different regions of the Member State, and the availability of relevant energy infrastr ucture, 
storag e, and other flexibility tools bear ing in mind the capacity needed to cater for the increasing amount of 
renewable energy , as well as environmental sensitivity in accordance with Annex III to Directive 2011/92/EU of the 
European Parliament and of the Council (14).
(26) Member States should designat e as a sub-set of those areas, specifi c land (including surfaces and sub-surfaces) and sea 
or inland water areas as renewables acceleration areas. Those areas should be particularly suitable for the purpose of 
developing renewable energy projects, differentiating between types of technology , on the basis that the deplo yment 
of the specifi c type of renewable energy source is not expect ed to have a significant envi ronmental impact. In the 
designation of renewables acceleration areas, Member State s should avoid prot ected areas and consider restoration 
plans and appropr iate mitig ation measures. Member States should be able to designat e renewables acceleration 
areas specifi cally for one or more types of renewable energy plants and should indicate the type or types of energy 
from renewable sources that are suitable to be produced in such renewables acceleration areas. Member States 
(14)Directive 2011/92/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on the assessment of the effects of certain 
public and private projects on the environment (OJ L 26, 28.1.2012, p. 1).OJ L, 31.10.2023 EN  ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2023/2413/oj 8/77should designate such renewables acceleration areas for at least one type of technology and should decide the size of 
such renewables acceleration areas, in view of the specificities and requirements of the type or types of technology 
for whic h they set up renewables acceleration areas. In doing so, Member State s should aim to ensure that the 
combined size of those areas is signif icant and that they contr ibut e to the achieve ment of the objectives set out in 
Directive (EU) 2018/2001.
(27) The multiple use of space for renewable energy production and other land, inland water and sea uses, such as food 
production or nature prot ection or restoration, alleviates the constraints on land, inland water and sea use. In that 
conte xt, spatial planning is an essential tool with whic h to identify and steer synergies for land, inland water and sea 
use at an early stage. Member States should explore, enable and favour multiple uses of the areas identif ied as a result 
of the spatial planning measures adopt ed. To that end, Member State s should facilitate changes in land and sea use 
where required, provided that the different uses and activities are compat ible with one another and can co-exist.
(28) Directive 2001/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (15)establishes environmental assessments as 
an important tool with which to integrat e environmental considerations into the preparation and adop tion of plans 
and programmes. In order to designat e renewables acceleration areas, Member States should prepare one or more 
plans that encompass the designation of renewables acceleration areas and the applicable rules and mitig ation 
measures for projects located in each of those areas. Member State s should be able to prepare a sing le plan for all 
renewables acceleration areas and renewable energy technology , or technology-specific plans whic h designat e one 
or more renewables acceleration areas. Each plan should be subject to an envi ronmental assessment pursuant to 
Directive 2001/42/EC in order to assess the impact of each renewable energy technology on the relevant areas 
designate d in that plan. Carrying out an environmental assessment pursuant to that Directive for that purpose 
would allow Member States to have a more integrat ed and efficient approac h to planning, to ensure public 
participation at an early stage, and to take environmental considerations into account at an early phase of the 
planning process at a strateg ic level. That would contr ibut e to ram ping up the deplo yment of differ ent renewable 
energy sources in a faster and more streamlined manner , while minimising the adverse environmental effects from 
those projects. Those environmental assessments should include transboundar y consultations between Member 
State s if the plan is likely to have significant adverse effects on the environment in another Member State.
(29) Following the adoptio n of the plans designating renewables acceleration areas, Member States should monitor any 
signif icant adverse envi ronmental effects of the implementation of plans and programmes in order , inter alia, to 
identify , at an early stage, unforeseen adverse effects and to be able to under take appropr iate remedial action, in 
accordance with Directive 2001/42/EC.
(30) To increase public accept ance of renewable energy projects, Member States should take appropr iate measures to 
promote the participation of local communities in renewable energy projects. The provis ions of the United Nations 
Economic Commission for Europe Convention on access to information, public participation in decision-making 
and access to justice in environmental matte rs(16), signed in Aarhus on 25 June 1998 , in particular the provisions 
relating to public participation and to access to justice, remain applicable.
(31) In order to streamline the process of designation of renewables acceleration areas and avoid duplication of 
environmental assessments of a sing le area, it should be possible for Member States to declare areas which have 
already been designat ed as suitable for an accelerat ed deplo yment of renewable energy technology under national 
law as renewables acceleration areas. Such declarations should be subject to certain environmental conditions, 
ensur ing a high level of environmental prot ection. The possibility of designation of renewables acceleration areas in 
existing planning should be limited in time, in order to ensure that it does not jeopardise the standard process for 
designation of renewables acceleration areas. Projects locat ed in existing national designated areas in protect ed areas 
which cannot be declared as renewables acceleration areas should continue to operat e under the same conditions 
under which they were established.
(15)Directive 2001/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2001 on the assessment of the effects of certain plans 
and programmes on the environment (OJ L 197, 21.7.2001, p. 30).
(16)OJ L 124, 17.5.2005, p. 4.OJ L, 31.10.2023 EN  ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2023/2413/oj 9/77(32) Renewables acceleration areas, together with existing renewable energy plants, future renewable energy plants 
outside such areas and cooperation mechani sms, should aim to ensure that renewable energy production will be 
suffi cient to achi eve Member States’ contr ibution to the overall Union renewable energy target set in Article 3(1) of 
Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Member States should retain the possibility to grant permits for projects outside such 
areas.
(33) In the renewables acceleration areas, renewable energy projects that compl y with the rules and measures identif ied in 
the plans prepared by Member States, should benefit from a presump tion of not having signif icant effects on the 
environment. Theref ore, such projects should be exem pt from the oblig ation to carry out a specific environmental 
imp act assessment at project level within the meaning of Directive 2011/92/EU, with the excep tion of projects 
where Member State has deter mined to require an envi ronmental impa ct assessment in its national mandatory list 
of projects and of projects whic h are likely to have signif icant effects on the environment in another Member State 
or where a Member State that is likely to be signif icantly affect ed so requests. The oblig ations under the Convention 
on envi ronmental impact assessment in a transboundar y conte xt(17), signed in Espoo on 25 Febr uary 1991 , should 
remain applicable to Member State s where the project is likely to cause a signif icant transboundar y impact in a third 
countr y.
(34) The oblig ations set out in Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (18)remain 
applicable regar ding hydropo wer plants, including where a Member State decides to designat e renewables 
acceleration areas related to hydropower , with a view to ensur ing that a pote ntial adverse impact on the water body 
or wate r bodies concer ned is justified and that all relevant mitig ation measures are implement ed.
(35) The designation of renewables acceleration areas should allow renewable energy plants and co-locate d energy 
storag e, as well as the connection of such plants and storage to the grid, to benefi t from predictability and 
streamlined administrative permit-granting procedures. In particular , projects locat ed in renewables acceleration 
areas should benefit from accelerat ed administrative permit-granting procedures, including a tacit approval in the 
case of a lack of reply by the compe tent author ity on an intermediar y administrative step by the established 
deadline, unless the specifi c project is subject to an environmental impact assessment or where the principle of 
administrative tacit approval does not exist in the national law of the Member State concer ned. Those projects 
should also benefi t from clear deadlines and legal certainty as regards the expected outcome of the permit-granting 
procedure. Once an application for a project in a renewables acceleration area is submitted , the Member State 
should carry out a fast screening process with the aim of identifying whether the project is highly likely to give rise 
to signif icant unforeseen adverse effects in view of the environmental sensitivity of the geographical area where it is 
locat ed and which were not identif ied during the environmental assessment of the plans designating renewables 
acceleration areas carried out pursuant to Directive 2001/42/EC and whether the project falls within the scope of 
Article 7 of Directive 2011/92/EU on the basis of the likelihood of its having signif icant effects on the environment 
in another Member State or on the basis of a request of a Member State which is likely to be significantly affect ed. For 
the purpose of such a screening process, the compet ent author ity should be able to request the applicant to provid e 
additional available information without requir ing a new assessment or data collection.
All projects locat ed in renewables acceleration areas that comply with the rules and measures identif ied in the plans 
prepared by Member States should be deemed to be approved at the end of such a screening process. Provide d that 
Member States have clear evidence to consider that a specif ic project is highly likely to give rise to such signif icant 
unforeseen adverse effects, Member States should, follo wing such a screening process, subject the project to an 
environmental impact assessment pursuant to Directive 2011/92/EU and, where relevant, an assessment pursuant 
to Council Directive 92/43/EEC (19). Member States should provide reasons for their decisions to subject projects to 
such assessments before those assessments are carried out. Such assessments should be carried out within six 
months of such decisions, with the possibility of extending that deadline on the ground of extraordinar y 
circumstances. It is appropr iate to allow Member States to introduce derogat ions from the oblig ation to carry out 
(17)OJ L 104, 24.4.1992, p. 7.
(18)Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community 
action in the field of water policy (OJ L 327, 22.12.2000, p. 1).
(19)Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conser vation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora (OJ L 206, 
22.7.1992, p. 7).OJ L, 31.10.2023 EN  ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2023/2413/oj 10/77such assessments for wind and solar photo voltaic projects in justif ied circumstances, because such projects are 
expecte d to provid e a vast majority of the renewable electr icity by 2030. In such a case, the project developer 
should adopt propor tionate mitig ation measures or, if not available, compensat ory measures, which , if other 
propor tionat e compensat ory measures are not available, may take the form of monetar y compensation, in order to 
address those significant unforeseen adverse effects identified during the screening process.
(36) In view of the need to accelerate the deplo yment of energy from renewable sources, the designation of renewables 
acceleration areas should not prevent the ongoing and future installation of renewable energy projects in all areas 
available for renewable energy deplo yment. Such projects should remain subject to the obligation to carry out a 
dedicate d environmental impa ct assessment pursuant to Directive 2011/92/EU and should be subject to the permit- 
granting procedures applicable to renewable energy projects locat ed outside renewables acceleration areas. To speed 
up permit-granting procedures on a scale necessar y for the achi evement of the renewable energy target set out in 
Directive (EU) 2018/2001, also the permit-granting procedures applicable to projects outside renewables 
acceleration areas should be simplified and streamlined with the introduction of clear maximum deadlines for all 
steps of the permit-granting procedure, including dedicated environmental assessments per project.
(37) The constr uction and operation of renewable energy plants can result in the occasional killing or disturbance of 
birds and other species protect ed under Directive 92/43/EEC or under Directive 2009/147/EC of the European 
Parliament and of the Council (20). However , such killing or disturbance of prot ected species should not be 
considered to be deliberate within the meaning of those Directives if the project for the constr uction and operation 
of those renewable energy plants provid es for appropr iate mitig ation measures to avoid such killing, to prevent 
disturbance, to assess the effectiveness of such measures through appropr iate monitoring and, in the light of the 
information gathered, to take further measures as required to ensure that there are no signif icant adverse impact on 
the population of the species concer ned.
(38) In addition to installing new renewable energy plants, repower ing of existing renewable energy power plants has 
signif icant potential to contr ibut e to the achi evement of the renewable energy targets . Since the existing renewable 
energy power plants have, for the most part, been installed in sites with signif icant renewable energy source 
poten tial, repo wering can ensure the continued use of those sites while reducing the need to designate new sites for 
renewable energy projects. Repoweri ng includes further benefits such as the existing grid connection, a likely higher 
degree of public accepta nce and kno wledge of the environmental impact.
(39) Directive (EU) 2018/2001 introduces streamlined permit-granting procedures for repowe ring. In order to respond 
to the increasing need for the repowe ring of existing renewable energy power plants and to mak e full use of the 
advantage s it offers, it is appropr iate to establish an even shor ter permit-granting procedure for the repowe ring of 
renewable energy power plants locat ed in renewables acceleration areas, including a shor ter screening process. For 
the repo wering of existing renewable energy power plants locat ed outside renewables acceleration areas, Member 
State s should ensure a simplified and swif t permit-granting procedure not exceed ing one year, while taking into 
account the ‘do no harm’ principle of the European Green Deal.
(40) In order to further promote and accelerat e the repo wering of existing renewable energy power plants, a simplified 
permit-granting procedure for grid connections should be established where the repowe ring results in a limited 
increase in total capacity compared to the original project. The repowe ring of renewable energy projects entails 
changes to or the exte nsion of existing projects to diffe rent degrees. The permit-granting procedure, including 
environmental assessments and screening, for the repowe ring of renewable energy projects should be limite d to the 
poten tial impact resulting from the change or extension compare d to the original project.
(20)Directive 2009/147/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 November 2009 on the conser vation of wild birds 
(OJ L 20, 26.1.2010, p. 7).OJ L, 31.10.2023 EN  ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2023/2413/oj 11/77(41) When repowe ring a solar installation, increases in efficiency and capacity can be achieved without increasing the 
space occupied. The repowe red installation thus does not have a diffe rent impa ct on the environment than the 
original installation, provided that the space used is not increased in the process, and the originally required 
environmental mitig ation measures continue to be complied with.
(42) The installation of solar energy equipment and related co-locat ed energy storag e, as well as the connection of such 
equipment and storage to the grid, in existing or future artificial structures creat ed for purposes other than solar 
energy production or energy storag e with the excl usion of artifici al wate r surfaces, such as roof tops, parking areas, 
roads and railwa ys, do not typically raise concer ns related to competing uses of space or envi ronmental impact. It 
should theref ore be possible for those installations to benefi t from shor ter permit-granting procedures and be 
exem pt from the oblig ation to carry out an environmental impact assessment pursuant to Directive 2011/92/EU, 
while allowing Member State s to take into account specifi c circumstances relating to the protection of cultural or 
histo rical heritage, national defence interests, or safety reasons. Self-consum ption installations, including those for 
collective self-consumers, such as local energy communities, also contr ibute to reducing overall demand for natural 
gas, to increasing resilience of the system and to achieving the Union’s renewable energy targe ts. The installation of 
solar energy equipment with a capacity below 100 kW, including installations of renewables self-consumers, is not 
likely to have significant adverse effects on the envi ronment or the grid and does not raise safety concer ns. In 
addition, small installations do not generally require capacity expansion at the grid-connection point. In view of the 
immediate positive effects of such installations for consumers and the limited environmental impa ct they may give 
rise to, it is appropr iate to further streamline the permit-granting procedure applicable to them, provided that they 
do not exceed the existing capacity of the connection to the distr ibution grid, by introducing the concep t of 
administrative positive silence in the relevant permit-granting procedures in order to promot e and accelerat e the 
deplo yment of those installations and to be able to reap their benefi ts in the shor t term. Member States should be 
allowe d to apply a threshold lower than 100 kW on the basis of their internal constraints, provided that the 
threshold remains higher than 10,8 kW.
(43) Heat pump technology is key to producing renewable heating and cooling from ambient energy , including from 
wastewa ter treatment plants and geother mal energy . Heat pumps also allow the use of waste heat and cold. The 
rapid deplo yment of heat pumps whic h mobilises under used renewable energy sources such as ambient energy or 
geother mal energy , as well as wast e heat from industr ial and tertiary sectors, including data centres, make s it 
possible to replace natural gas and other fossil fuel-based boilers with a renewable heating solution, while increasing 
energy efficiency . That will accelerat e a reduction in the use of gas for the supply of heating, in buildings as well as in 
industr y. In order to accelerat e the installation and use of heat pumps, it is appropr iate to introduce targe ted shor ter 
permit-granting procedures for such installations, including a simplified permit-granting procedure for the 
connection of smaller heat pumps to the electr icity grid where there are no safety concer ns, no further works are 
needed for grid connections and there is no technical incompatibility of the system compo nents, unless no such 
permit-granting procedure is required by national law. Thanks to a quic ker and easier installation of heat pump s, 
the increased use of renewable energy in the heating sector , whic h accounts for almost half of the Union’s energy 
consum ption, is intende d to contr ibut e to secur ity of supply and help tackle a more difficult market situation.
(44) For the purposes of the relevant Union envi ronmental law, in the necessar y case-b y-case assessments to ascer tain 
whether a renewable energy plant, the connection of that plant to the grid, the relat ed grid itself or storage assets 
are of overriding public interest in a particular case, Member States should presume those renewable energy plants 
and their related infrastr ucture to be of over riding public interest and serving public health and safety , excep t where 
there is clear evidence that those projects have signif icant adverse effects on the envi ronment which cannot be 
mitig ated or compen sated for, or where Member State s decide to restr ict the application of that presump tion in duly 
justif ied and specifi c circumstances, such as reasons related to national defe nce. Consider ing such renewable energy 
plants to be of over riding public interest and serving public health and safety would allow such projects to benefit 
from a simplified assessment.OJ L, 31.10.2023 EN  ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2023/2413/oj 12/77(45) In order to ensure a smooth and effective implementation of the provi sions laid down in this Directive, the 
Commission suppor ts Member States by means of the Techn ical Suppor t Instr ument established by Regulation 
(EU) 2021/240 of the European Parliament and of the Council (21), whic h provides tailor -made technical exper tise 
to design and implement reforms, including those increasing the use of energy from renewable sources, fostering 
bette r energy system integration, identifying specifi c areas particularly suitable for the installation of renewable 
energy plants, and streamlining the framewor k for author isation and permit-granting procedures for renewable 
energy plants. The technical suppor t, for example, involves strengthening of administrative capacity , harmonising 
the legislative framew orks, and the shar ing of relevant best practices such as enabling and favouring multiple uses.
(46) Energy infrastr ucture needs to be in place to suppor t the signif icant scaling up of renewable energy generation. 
Member States should be able to designate dedicat ed infrastr ucture areas where the deplo yment of grid or storage 
projects that are necessar y to integrat e renewable energy into the electr icity system is not expect ed to have a 
signif icant environmental imp act, such an impact can be duly mitig ated or, where not possible, compensat ed for. 
Infrastr ucture projects in such areas may benefit from more streamlined environmental assessments. If Member 
State s decide not to designat e such areas, the assessments and rules applicable under Union envi ronmental law 
remain applicable. In order to designat e infrastr ucture areas, Member States should prepare one or more plans, 
including by means of national legislation, encom passing the identification of the areas and the applicable rules and 
mitig ation measures for projects locat ed in each infrastr ucture area. The plans should clearly indicate the scope of 
the dedicated area and the type of infrastr ucture projects covered. Each plan should be subject to an envi ronmental 
assessment pursuant to Directive 2001/42/EC in order to assess the impact of each type of project on the relevant 
designate d areas. Grids projects in such dedicat ed infrastr ucture areas should avoid to the extent possible Natura 
2000 sites and areas designat ed under national protect ion schemes for nature and biodiversity conser vation, unless, 
due to the specif icities of grid projects, there are no propor tionat e alternati ves for the deplo yment of such projects. 
When assessing propor tionality , Member States should take into account the need to ensure the economic viability , 
the feasibility and the effective and accelerated implementation of the project with a view to ensur ing that the 
additional generation capacity of renewable energy deplo yed can be promp tly integrated into the energy system, or 
whether infrastr ucture projects of various types already exist in the specifi c Natura 2000 site or prote cted area, 
which would allow to bundle differ ent infrastr ucture projects in a site resulting in lowe r environmental impact.
Dedicat ed plans for storage projects should alwa ys exclude Natura 2000 sites since there are less constraints on 
where to place them. In such areas, Member States should, under justified circumstances including where needed to 
accelerat e the grid expansion to suppor t the deplo yment of renewable energy to achieve the climate and renewable 
energy targets, be able to introduce exem ptions from certain assessment oblig ations provided for in Union 
environmental law under certain conditions. If Member State s decide to make use of such exem ptions, the specific 
projects should be subject to a streamlined screening process similar to the screening process provided for 
renewables acceleration areas, which should be based on existing data. Requests of the compet ent author ity to 
provid e additional available information should not require a new assessment or data collection. If such a screening 
process identif ies projects that are highly likely to give rise to significant unforeseen adverse effects, the compet ent 
author ity should ensure that appropr iate and propor tionate mitig ation measures, or if not available, compen satory 
measures, are applied. In the case of compensat ory measures, the project development can be pursued while 
compen satory measures are being identif ied.
(47) Insuffi cient numbers of skilled work ers, in particular installers and designers of renewable heating and cooling 
systems , slows down the replacement of fossil fuel heating systems by renewable energy based syste ms and is a 
signif icant barrier to integrating renewable energy in buildings, industr y and agriculture. Member State s should 
cooperate with social partners and renewable energy communities to anticipate the skills that will be needed. A 
suffi cient number of high-quality and effective upskilling and reskilling strateg ies and training programmes and 
certification possibilities that ensure proper installation and reliable operation of a wide range of renewable heating 
and cooling system s and storag e technology , as well as electr ic vehicles recharging points, should be made available 
(21)Regulation (EU) 2021/240 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 Febr uary 2021 establishing a Technical Suppor t 
Instr ument (OJ L 57, 18.2.2021, p. 1).OJ L, 31.10.2023 EN  ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2023/2413/oj 13/77and designed in a way to attract participation in such training programmes and certification system s. Member States 
should consider what actions should be taken to attract groups currently under -represente d in the occupational 
areas in question. A list of trained and certified installers should be made publicly available to ensure consumer 
trust and easy access to tailored installer and designer skills guarant eeing proper installation and operation of 
renewable heating and cooling.
(48) Guarant ees of origin are a key tool for consumer information as well as for the further uptak e of renewable energy 
purchas e agreements. It should theref ore be ensured that the issue, trade, transfer and use of guarantees of origin 
can be carried out in a unif orm system with appropr iately standardised certificates that are mutually recognised 
throughout the Union. Further more, to provide access to appropr iate suppor ting evidence for persons concluding 
renewable energy purch ase agreements, it should be ensured that any associated guarantees of origin can be 
transferr ed to the buyer . In the conte xt of a more flexible energy syste m and growin g consumer demand there is a 
call for a more innovative, digital, technologically advanced and reliable tool to suppor t and document the 
increasing production of renewable energy . To facilitat e digital inno vation in that field, Member State s should, 
where appropr iate, enable issuing guarant ees of origin in fractions and with a closer to real time timestamp. In view 
of the need to impro ve consumer empo werment and contr ibute to a higher share of renewable energy in the gas 
supply , Member States should require netw ork gas suppliers who disclose their energy mix to final consumers, to 
use guarantees of origin.
(49) Infrastr ucture development for distr ict heating and cooling netw orks should be stepped up and steered towards 
harnessing a wider range of renewable heat and cold sources in an efficient and flexible way in order to increase the 
deplo yment of renewable energy and deepen energy system integration. It is theref ore appropr iate to update the list 
of renewable energy sources that distr ict heating and cooling netw orks should increasing ly accommodat e and to 
require the integration of ther mal energy storage as a source of flexibility , greater energy efficiency and more cost- 
effective operation.
(50) With more than 30 million electr ic vehicles expected in the Union by 2030 it is necessar y to ensure that they can 
fully contr ibute to the system integration of renewable electr icity , and thus allow reaching higher shares of 
renewable electr icity in a cost-op timal manner . The pote ntial of electr ic vehicles to absorb renewable electr icity at 
times when it is abundant and feed it back into a grid when there is scarcity , contr ibuting to the system integration 
of variable renewable electr icity while ensur ing a secure and reliable supply of electr icity , has to be fully utilised. It is 
theref ore appropr iate to introduce specific measures on electr ic vehicles and information about renewable energy 
and about how and when to access it which compl ement those in Regulations (EU) 2023/1804 (22)and 
(EU) 2023/1542 (23)of the European Parliament and of the Council.
(51) Regulation (EU) 2019/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council (24)and Directive (EU) 2019/944 of the 
European Parliament and of the Council (25)require Member States to allow and foster the participation of demand 
response through aggreg ation, as well as to provide for dynamic electr icity price contracts to final custom ers where 
applicable. In order to allow demand response more easily to provide further incentives for the absor ption of green 
electr icity , it needs to be based not only on dynamic prices but also on signals about the actual penetration of green 
electr icity in the system. It is theref ore necessar y to impro ve the signals that consumers and mark et participants 
receive regar ding the share of renewable electr icity and the intensi ty of greenhouse gas emissions of the electr icity 
supplied, through the dissemination of dedicat ed information. Consump tion patter ns can then be adjusted on the 
(22)Regulation (EU) 2023/1804 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 Sept ember 2023 on the deplo yment of alternative 
fuels infrastr ucture, and repealing Directive 2014/94/EU (OJ L 234, 22.9.2023, p. 1).
(23)Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2023 concer ning batteries and wast e batteries, 
amending Directive 2008/98/EC and Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 and repealing Directive 2006/66/EC (OJ L 191, 28.7.2023, p. 1).
(24)Regulation (EU) 2019/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on the internal market for electr icity 
(OJ L 158, 14.6.2019, p. 54).
(25)Directive (EU) 2019/944 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on common rules for the internal market for 
electr icity and amending Directive 2012/27/EU (OJ L 158, 14.6.2019, p. 125).OJ L, 31.10.2023 EN  ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2023/2413/oj 14/77basis of renewable energy penetration and the presence of zero carbon electr icity , in conjunction with an adjustment 
made on the basis of price signals. That serves the objective of further suppor ting the deplo yment of innovative 
business models and digital solutions, which have the capacity to link consump tion to the level of renewable energy 
in the electr icity grid and thus provide incentives for the right network investments to under pin the clean energy 
transition.
(52) In order for flexibility and balancing services from the aggrega tion of distr ibut ed storag e assets to be developed in a 
competitive manner , real-time access to basic batter y information such as state of health, state of charge, capacity 
and power set point should be provided under non-discr iminato ry terms, in accordance with the relevant data 
prote ction rules and free of charge to the owners or users of the batt eries and the entities acting on their behalf, 
such as building energy system managers, mobility service provid ers and other electr icity mark et participants. It is 
theref ore appropr iate to introduce measures that address the need of access to such data for facilitating the 
integration-r elated operations of domestic batter ies and electr ic vehicles, that complement the provisions on access 
to batte ry data related to facilitating the repur posing of batter ies laid down in Regulation (EU) 2023/1542. The 
provisions on access to the batt ery data of electr ic vehicles should apply in addition to any provisions laid down in 
Union law on the type approval of vehicles.
(53) The increasing number of electr ic vehicles in road, rail, mar itime and other transpor t modes will require recharging 
operations to be optimised and manag ed in a way that does not cause congestion and takes full advantage of the 
availability of renewable electr icity and low electr icity prices in the system. Where smar t and bi-directional 
rech arging would assist further penetration of renewable electr icity by electr ic vehicle fleets in the transpor t sector 
and in the electr icity system in general, such functionality should also be made available. In view of the long life 
span of recharging points, requirements for recha rging infrastr ucture should be kept updated in a way that would 
cater for future needs and would not result in negativ e lock-in effects to the development of technology and services.
(54) Rechar ging points where electr ic vehicles typically park for extende d periods of time, such as where people park for 
reasons of residence or emplo yment, are highly relevant to energy syste m integration. Smar t and, where appropr iate, 
bi-directional recharging functionalities theref ore need to be ensured. In that regard, the operation of non-publicly 
accessible normal recharging infrastr ucture is particularly impor tant for the integration of electr ic vehicles in the 
electr icity system as it is locat ed where electr ic vehicles are park ed repeatedly for long periods of time, such as in 
buildings with restr icted access, emplo yee parking or parking facilities rente d out to natural or legal persons.
(55) Demand response is pivotal to enabling the smar t recharging of electr ic vehicles and thereby enabling the efficient 
integration of electr ic vehicles into the electr icity grid, whic h will be crucial for the process of decarbonising 
transpor t and for the purposes of facilitating energy syste m integra tion. In addition, Member States should 
encourage , where relevant, initiatives promoting demand response through interoperability and data exchang e for 
heating and cooling systems, ther mal energy storag e units and other relevant energy related devices.
(56) Electr ic vehicle users enter ing into contractual agreements with electromobility service provid ers and electr icity 
mark et participants should have the right to receive information and explanations on how the terms of the 
agreement will affect the use of their vehicle and the state of health of its batt ery. Electromobility service providers 
and electr icity market participants should explain clearly to electr ic vehicle users how they will be remunerated for 
the flexibility , balancing and storag e services provided to the electr icity system and mark et by the use of their 
electr ic vehicle. Electr ic vehicle users also need to have their consumer rights secured when entering into such 
agreements, in particular regar ding the prote ction of their personal data such as location and driving habits, in 
connection to the use of their vehicle. Electr ic vehicle users’ pref erence regarding the type of electr icity purchased 
for use in their electr ic vehicle, as well as other prefe rences, can also be part of such agreements. For those reasons, 
it is important to ensure that the rech arging infrastr ucture deplo yed is used as effectively as possible. In order to OJ L, 31.10.2023 EN  ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2023/2413/oj 15/77imp rove consumer conf idence in e-mobility , it is essential that electr ic vehicle users can use their subscr iption at 
multiple recharging points. That will also allow the electr ic vehicle user ’s service provider of choice to optimally 
integrat e the electr ic vehicle in the electr icity syste m, through predictable planning and incentives on the basis of 
electr ic vehicle user preferen ces. That is also in line with the principles of a consumer -centr ic and prosumer -based 
energy syste m, and the right of supplier choice of electr ic vehicle users as final customers as per the provisions of 
Directive (EU) 2019/944.
(57) Distr ibut ed storage assets, such as domestic batte ries and batter ies of electr ic vehicles have the poten tial to offer 
considerable flexibility and balancing services to the grid through aggreg ation. In order to facilitate the 
development of such devices and services, the regulatory provisions concer ning connection and operation of the 
storag e assets, such as tariffs, commitment times and connection specifi cations, should be designed in a way that 
does not hamp er the poten tial of all stora ge assets, including small and mobile ones and other devices for exam ple, 
heat pumps, solar panels and ther mal storag e, to offer flexibility and balancing services to the system and to 
contr ibut e to the further penetration of renewable electr icity , in comparison with larger, stationar y storage assets. In 
addition to the general provisions preventing market discr imination laid down in Regulation (EU) 2019/943 and 
Directive (EU) 2019/944, specific requirements should be introduced to address holistically the participation of 
those assets and to remove any remaining barriers and obstacles to unleash the potential of such assets to help the 
decarbonisation of the electr icity system and empo wer the consumers to actively participat e in the energy transition.
(58) As a general principle, Member States should ensure a level playing field for small, decentralised electr icity 
generation and storag e systems, including through batter ies and electr ic vehicles, so they are able to participate in 
the electr icity markets, including cong estion management and the provision of flexibility and balancing services in 
a non-discr iminato ry manner as compared to other electr icity generation and stora ge system s, and without 
dispropor tionat e administrative or regulator y burden. Member States should encourage self-consumers and 
renewable energy communities to actively participate in those electr icity mark ets by provi ding flexibility services 
through demand response and storag e including through batte ries and electr ic vehicles.
(59) Industr y accounts for 25 % of the Union’s energy consum ption, and is a major consumer of heating and cooling, 
which is currently supplied 91 % by fossil fuels. Howe ver, 50 % of demand for heating and cooling is low- 
temperature (< 200 °C) for which there are cost-eff ective renewable energy options, including through 
electr ification and direct use of renewable energy . In addition, industr y uses non-renewable sources as raw mate rials 
to produce products such as steel or chemicals. Industr ial inve stment decisions toda y will deter mine the future 
industr ial processes and energy options that can be considered by industr y, so it is imp ortant that those investments 
decisions are future-proof and avoid the creation of stranded assets. Theref ore, benc hmark s should be put in place to 
provid e industr y with incentives to switc h to production processes based on renewable energy , whic h are not only 
fuelled by renewable energy , but also use renewable-based raw mate rials such as renewable hydrogen. Member 
State s should promote the electr ification of industr ial processes where possible, for instance for low temperature 
industr ial heat. Moreover , Member States should promote the use of a common methodology for products that are 
labelled as having been produced partially or fully using renewable energy or using renewable fuels of non- 
biological origin as feedstoc k, taking into account existing Union product labelling methodologies and sustainable 
product initiatives. That would avoid decep tive practices and increase consumer trust. Further more, given 
consumer preferen ce for products that contr ibute to environmental and climate chang e objectives, it would 
stimulate market demand for those products.
(60) To reduce the Union’s dependence on fossil fuels and fossil fuel imp orts, a Union strateg y for imported and domestic 
hydrogen should be developed by the Commission on the basis of data repor ted by Member States.OJ L, 31.10.2023 EN  ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2023/2413/oj 16/77(61) Renewable fuels of non-biological origin can be used for energy purposes, but also for non-energy purposes as 
feedstoc k or raw mater ial in industr ies such as the steel industr y or the chemical industr y. The use of renewable 
fuels of non-biological origin for both purposes exploits their full poten tial to replace fossil fuels used as feedstoc k 
and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in industr ial processes whic h are difficult to electr ify and should theref ore 
be included in a target for the use of renewable fuels of non-biological origin. National measures to suppor t the 
uptak e of renewable fuels of non-biological origin in those industr ial sectors that are difficult to electr ify should not 
result in net pollution increases due to an increased demand for electr icity generation that is satisfied by the most 
polluting fossil fuels, such as coal, diesel, lignite, oil peat and oil shale. The consum ption of hydrogen in industr ial 
processes whereby the hydrogen is produced as or derived from a by-product whic h is difficult to replace with 
renewable fuels of non-biological origin should be excl uded from that target. Hydroge n consumed to produce 
transpor t fuel is covered under the transpor t targets for renewable fuels of non-biological origin.
(62) The Union’s hydrog en strateg y, set out in the Commission communication of 8 July 2020 , entitled ‘A hydrog en 
strateg y for a climate -neutral Europe’, recognises the role of existing hydrogen production plants retrofi tted to 
reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in achieving the increased 2030 climate ambition. In light of that strateg y, 
and within the framew ork of the call for projects organised under the Union’s Innovation Fund established by 
Article 10a(8) of Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (26), early mov ers have taken 
inve stment decisions with a view to retrofi tting pre-existing hydrog en production facilities based on steam methane 
reforming technology with the aim of decarbonising hydrog en production. For the purpose of calculating the 
denominator in the contr ibution of renewable fuels of non-biological origin used for final energy and non-energy 
purposes in industr y, hydrog en produced in retrofi tted production facilities based on steam methane reforming 
technology for which a Commission decision with a view to the award of a grant under the Inno vation Fund has 
been published before the date of entr y into force of this Directive and that achieve an averag e greenhouse gas 
reduction of 70 % on an annual basis, should not be taken into account.
(63) Moreover , it should be ackn owledg ed that the replacement of hydrogen produced from the steam methane 
reforming process might pose specif ic challenges for certain existing integra ted ammonia production facilities. It 
would necessitate the rebuilding of such production facilities, which would require a substantial effort by Member 
State s depending on their specifi c national circumstances and the structure of their energy supply .
(64) In order to achieve the objective of the Union to become climate neutral by 2050 and to decarbonise Union’s 
industr y, Member States should be able to combine the use of non-f ossil energy sources and renewable fuels of non- 
biological origin in the context of their specific national circumstances and energy mix. In that context, Member 
State s should be able to reduce the targe t for the use of renewable fuels of non-biological origin in the industr y 
sector , provided that they consume a limited share of hydrog en or its derivatives produced from fossil fuels and that 
they are on track towards their expected national contr ibution in accordance with the formula of Annex II to 
Regulation (EU) 2018/1999.
(65) Increasing ambition in the heating and cooling sector is key to deliver ing the overall renewable energy target given 
that heating and cooling constitute s around half of the Union’s energy consum ption, cover ing a wide range of end 
uses and technology in buildings, industr y and distr ict heating and cooling. To accelerat e the increase of renewable 
energy in the heating and cooling sector , a minimum annual percentage point increase at Member State level should 
be made binding on all Member States. The minimum annual average binding increase of 0,8 percentage points 
between 2021 and 2025, and of 1,1 percentage points between 2026 and 2030 in heating and cooling applicable 
to all Member States should be compl emented with additional indicative increases or top- up rates calculat ed 
specifi cally for each Member State in order to reach an average increase of 1,8 percentage points at Union level. 
Those Member State-specific additional indicative increases or top- ups aim to redistr ibut e the additional effort 
needed to achieve the desired level of renewable energy in 2030 among Member States on the basis of gross 
(26)Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 Octo ber 2003 establishing a system for greenhouse gas 
emission allowance trading within the Union and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC (OJ L 275, 25.10.2003, p. 32).OJ L, 31.10.2023 EN  ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2023/2413/oj 17/77domestic product and cost-effe ctiveness and to guide Member States as regar ds what could be a sufficient level of 
renewable energy to deplo y in that sector . Member States should carry out, in accordance with the energy efficiency 
first principle, an assessment of their pote ntial energy from renewable sources in the heating and cooling sector and 
of the potential use of waste heat and cold. Member State s should implement two or more measures from the list of 
measures to facilitate increasing the share of renewable energy in heating and cooling. When adopt ing and 
imp lementing those measures, Member State s should ensure that those measures are accessible to all consumers, in 
particular those living in low-income or vulnerable households.
(66) To ensure that the increased importance of distr ict heating and cooling is accompan ied by bette r information for 
consumers, it is appropr iate to clarify and strengthen transparency as regar ds the share of renewable energy and the 
energy efficiency of distr ict heating and cooling systems.
(67) Moder n renewable-based efficient distr ict heating and cooling syste ms have demonstrated their poten tial to provid e 
cost-effe ctive solutions for integrat ing renewable energy , increased energy efficiency and energy system integration, 
while facilitating the overall decarbonisation of the heating and cooling sector. To ensure that that potential is 
harnessed, the annual increase of renewable energy or wast e heat and cold in distr ict heating and cooling should be 
raised from 1 to 2,2 percentag e points without changing the indicative nature of that increase, reflecting the uneven 
development of that type of network across the Union.
(68) To reflect the increased importance of distr ict heating and cooling and the need to steer the development of those 
netw orks towards the integration of more renewable energy , it is appropr iate to encourag e operat ors of distr ict 
heating or cooling system s to connect third party suppliers of renewable energy and waste heat and cold with 
distr ict heating or cooling netw orks systems abov e 25 MW .
(69) Heating and cooling systems, in particular distr ict heating and cooling systems , increasing ly contr ibute to the 
balancing of the electr icity grid by provid ing additional demand for variable renewable electr icity , such as wind and 
solar , when such renewable electr icity is abundant, cheap and would be other wise curtailed. Such balancing can be 
achi eved by means of the use of highly efficient electr ically driven heat and cold generat ors, such as heat pumps, 
especially when those heat and cold generat ors are coupled with large ther mal stora ge, in particular in distr ict 
heating and cooling or in individual heating, where the economies of scale and syste m level efficiencies of distr ict 
heating and cooling are not available. The benefits of heat pumps are twof old, first, to signif icantly increase energy 
efficiency , saving considerable energy and costs for consumers, and second, to integrat e renewable energy through 
allowin g a greater use of geother mal and ambient energy . In order to provide further incentives for the use of 
renewable electr icity for heating and cooling and heat storage, with the deplo yment of heat pumps in particular , it is 
appropr iate to allow Member States to count renewable electr icity driving those heat and cold generat ors, including 
heat pumps towards the binding and indicative renewable energy annual increase in the heating and cooling and 
distr ict heating and cooling.
(70) Despite being widely available, waste heat and cold is under used, leading to a wast e of resources, lower energy 
efficiency in national energy systems and higher than necessar y energy consum ption in the Union. Prov ided it is 
supplied from effic ient distr ict heating and cooling, it is appropr iate to allow waste heat and cold to count towards 
partial fulfilment of the targe ts for renewable energy in buildings, industr y, heating and cooling and towards 
compl ete fulfilment of the targe ts for distr ict heating and cooling. That would allow synergies between renewable 
energy and waste heat and cold in distr ict heating and cooling netw orks to be harnessed by increasing the economic 
rationale for investing in the moder nisation and development of those networks. Specifi cally including waste heat in 
the industr ial renewable energy benc hmark should be acceptable only as regards waste heat or cold delivered via a 
distr ict heating and cooling operat or from another industr ial site or another building, thus ensur ing that such 
operat ors have heat or cold supply as their main activity and that the waste heat counte d is clearly differentiat ed 
from intern al waste heat recovered within the same or related enterprise or buildings.OJ L, 31.10.2023 EN  ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2023/2413/oj 18/77(71) To ensure distr ict heating and cooling participate fully in energy sector integration, it is necessar y to extend the 
cooperation with electr icity distr ibution system operators to electr icity transmission system operators and to widen 
the scope of cooperation to grid investment planning and mark ets in order to better utilise the potential of distr ict 
heating and cooling for providing flexibility services in electr icity mark ets. Further cooperation with gas netw ork 
operat ors, including hydrog en and other energy netw orks, should also be made possible to ensure a wider 
integration across energy carriers and their most cost-effe ctive use. Further more, requirements for closer 
coordination between distr ict heating and cooling operators, industr ial and tertiary sectors, and local author ities 
could facilita te the dialogue and cooperation necessar y to harness cost-effective waste heat and cold pote ntials via 
distr ict heating and cooling systems.
(72) The use of renewable fuels and renewable electr icity in the transpor t sector can contr ibute to the decarbonisation of 
the Union transpor t sector in a cost-eff ective manner , and improve, amongst other matte rs, energy diversifi cation in 
that sector while promoting innovation, economic growth and jobs in the Union and while reducing reliance on 
energy impor ts. With a view to achi eving the increased target for greenhouse gas emissions savings set by 
Regulation (EU) 2021/1119, the level of renewable energy supplied to all transpor t modes in the Union should be 
increased. Allowing the Member States to choose between a transpor t target expressed as a greenhouse gas intensity 
reduction target or as a share of the consum ption of renewable energy provides the Member States with an 
appropr iate degree of flexibility to design their policies to decarbonise transpor t. Further more, introducing a 
combined energy-based targe t for advanced biofuels and biogas and renewable fuels of non-biological origin, 
including a minimum share for renewable fuels of non-biological origin would ensure an increased use of the 
renewable fuels with smallest environmental imp act in transpor t modes that are difficult to electr ify such as 
mar itime transpor t and aviation. To kick start the fuel shift in mar itime transpor t, Member States with mar itime 
ports should endeav our to ensure that from 2030 the share of renewable fuels of non-biological origin in the total 
amount of energy supplied to the mar itime transpor t sector is at least 1,2 %. The achi evement of those targets 
should be ensured by oblig ations on fuel suppliers as well as by other measures laid down in Regulations 
(EU) 2023/1805 (27)and (EU) 2023/2405 (28)of the European Parliament and of the Council. Dedicat ed oblig ations 
on aviatio n fuel suppliers should be imposed only pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2023/2405.
(73) In order to encourage the uptak e of the supply of renewable fuels to the hard-to-decarbonise sector of internatio nal 
mar ine bunker ing, for the calculation of the transpor t targe ts, renewable fuels supplied to intern ational mar ine 
bunk ers should be included in the final consum ption of energy from renewable sources in the transpor t sector and, 
according ly, fuels supplied to international mar ine bunkers should be included in the final consump tion of energy 
sources in the transpor t sector . However , mar itime transpor t represents a large share of the gross final consump tion 
of energy for some Member States. In view of the current technological and regulatory constraints that prevent the 
commercial use of biofuels in the mar itime transpor t sector , it is appropr iate, by way of derog ation from the 
requirement to include all energy supplied to the mar itime transpor t sector, for the purpose of calculating specifi c 
transpor t target s, to allow Member States to cap the energy supplied to the mar itime transpor t sector at 13 % of the 
gross final consump tion of energy in a Member State. For insular Member States, where the gross final consum ption 
of energy in the mar itime transpor t sector is dispropor tionally high, namely more than a third of that of the road 
and rail sector s, the cap should be 5 %. However , for the calculation of the overall renewable energy target, 
consider ing the specifi c charact eristics of internatio nal mar ine bunk ers, rega rding fuels supplied to them, they 
should be included in the gross final consum ption of energy of a Member State only if they are renewable.
(27)Regulation (EU) 2023/1805 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 September 2023 on the use of renewable and low- 
carbon fuels in mar itime transpor t, and amending Directive 2009/16/EC (OJ L 234, 22.9.2023, p. 48).
(28)Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 October 2023 on ensur ing a level playing field for 
sustainable air transpor t (ReFuelEU Aviation) (OJ L, 2023/2405, 31.10.2023, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/2405/oj).OJ L, 31.10.2023 EN  ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2023/2413/oj 19/77(74) Electromobility will play an essential role in decarbonising the transpor t sector . To foster the further development of 
electromobility , Member States should establish a credit mech anism enabling operat ors of recharging points 
accessible to the public to contr ibut e, by supplying renewable electr icity , towards the fulfilment of the oblig ation set 
up by Member State s on fuel suppliers. Member States should be able to include private recharging points in that 
credit mec hanism, if it can be demonstrated that the renewable electr icity supplied to those private rech arging 
points is provided solely to electr ic vehicles. While suppor ting electr icity in the transpor t sector through such credit 
mechani sms, it is imp ortant that Member States continue to set a high level of ambition for the decarbonisation of 
their liquid fuel mix, particularly in hard-to -decarbonise transpor t sectors , such as mar itime transpor t and aviatio n, 
where direct electr ification is much more difficult.
(75) Renewable fuels of non-biological origin, including renewable hydrogen, can be used as feedstoc k or as a source of 
energy in industr ial and chemical processes and in mar itime transpor t and aviation, decarbonising sectors in which 
direct electr ification is not technologically possible or competitive. They can also be used for energy stora ge to 
balance, where necessar y, the energy system, thereby playing a significant role in energy system integration.
(76) The Union’s renewable energy policy aims to contr ibute to achieving the Union’s climat e change mitig ation 
objectives in terms of the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In the pursuit of that goal, it is essential to also 
contr ibut e to wider environmental objectives and in particular the prevention of biodiversity loss, on which the 
indirect land use change associated with the production of certain biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels has a 
negativ e impact. Contr ibuting to those climat e and environmental objectives constitute s a deep and longstanding 
inter generational concer n for Union citizens and the Union legislator s. The Union should thus promote those fuels 
in quantities whic h balance the necessar y ambition with the need to avoid contr ibuting to direct and indirect land- 
use chang e. The way the transpor t target is calculated should not affect the limits established on how certain fuels 
produced from food and feed crops on the one hand and high indirect land-use change -risk fuels on the other hand 
count towards that target. In addition, in order not to create an incentive to use biofuels and biogas produced from 
food and feed crops in transpor t and consider ing the impa ct of the war against Ukraine on food and feed supply , 
Member States should continue to be able to choose whether to count biofuels and biogas produced from food and 
feed crops towards the transpor t target. If they do not count them, Member States should be able to choose to reduce 
the energy-based targe t or to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity reduction target according ly, assuming that 
biofuels produced from food and feed crops save 50 % greenhouse gas emissions, whic h corresponds to the typical 
values set out in an annex to this Directive for the greenhouse gas emissions savings of the most relevant 
production pathwa ys of biofuels produced from food and feed crops as well as the minimum greenhouse gas 
emissions savings threshold that applies to most installations producing such biofuels.
(77) In order to ensure that the use of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels saves an increasing amount of greenhouse 
gas emissions and to address poten tial indirect effects of the promotion of such fuels, such as deforestation, the 
Commission should review the level of the maximum share of the average annual expansion of the global 
production area in high carbon stoc ks based on objective and scientific criteria, taking into consideration the 
Union’s climat e target s and commitments, and should, where necessar y, propose a new threshold on the basis of 
the results of its review . Further , the Commission should assess the possibility of designing an accelerat ed traject ory 
to phase out the contr ibution of such fuels to renewable energy target s in order to maximise the amount of 
greenhouse gas emissions savings.
(78) Setting the transpor t target as a greenhouse gas intensity reduction targe t makes it necessar y to provid e for a 
methodology that takes into consideration that diffe rent types of energy from renewable sources save diffe rent 
amounts of greenhouse gas emissions and, theref ore, contr ibut e diffe rently to a given target. Renewable electr icity 
should be considered to have zero greenhouse gas emissions, meaning it saves 100 % of greenhouse gas emissions 
compare d to electr icity produced from fossil fuels. That will creat e an incentive for the use of renewable electr icity 
since renewable fuels and recy cled carbon fuels are unlikely to achi eve such a high percentage of greenhouse gas 
emissions savings. Electr ification relying on renewable energy sources would theref ore become the most efficient OJ L, 31.10.2023 EN  ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2023/2413/oj 20/77way to decarbonise road transpor t. In addition, in order to promote the use of renewable fuels of non-biological 
origin in the aviation and mar itime transpor t modes, which are difficult to electr ify, it is appropr iate to introduce a 
multiplier for fuels supplied in those modes of transpor t when counting them towards the specifi c targets set for 
those fuels.
(79) The direct electr ification of end-use sectors, including the transpor t sector, contr ibut es to system efficiency and 
facilitates the transition to an energy system based on renewable energy . It is theref ore in itself an effective means to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The creation of a framew ork on additionality whic h applies specifically to 
renewable electr icity supplied to electr ic vehicles in the transpor t sector is theref ore not required. Further more, 
solar -electr ic vehicles can make a crucial contr ibution to the decarbonisation of the Union’s transpor t sector.
(80) Since renewable fuels of non-biological origin are to be counted as renewable energy regardl ess of the sector in 
which they are consumed, the rules to determine their renewable nature when produced from electr icity , which 
were applicable only to those fuels when consumed in the transpor t sector, should be extended to all renewable 
fuels of non-biological origin, rega rdless of the sector in whic h they are consumed.
(81) Renewable fuels of non-biological origin are important to increasing the share of renewable energy in sectors that 
are expect ed to rely on gaseous and liquid fuels in the long-ter m, including for industr ial applications and in heavy- 
duty transpor t. By 1 July 2028 , the Commission should assess the impact of the methodology defining when 
electr icity used for producing renewable fuels of non-biological origin can be considered to be fully renewable, 
including the impact of additionality and temporal and geographical correlation on production costs, greenhouse 
gas emissions savings, and the energy system and should submit a repor t to the European Parliament and the 
Council. The repor t should assess in a particular the impact of that methodology on the availabi lity and 
affordability of renewable fuels of non-biological origin for industr y and transpor t sectors and on the ability of the 
Union to achieve its targets for renewable fuels of non-biological origin, taking into account the Union strategy for 
imp orted and domestic hydrogen while minimising the increase in greenhouse gas emissions in the electr icity sector 
and the overall energy system. If that repor t concludes that the methodology falls shor t of ensur ing sufficient 
availability and affordability and does not substantially contr ibut e to greenhouse gas emissions savings, energy 
system integration and the achi evement of the Union targets for 2030 for renewable fuels of non-biological origin, 
the Commission should review the Union methodology and, where appropr iate, adop t a delegat ed act to amend the 
methodology to provide the necessar y adjustments to the criteria in order to facilitate the ramping-up of the 
hydrogen industr y.
(82) To ensure higher environmental effectiveness of the Union sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving 
criteria for solid biomass fuels in installations producing heating, electr icity and cooling, the minimum threshold 
for the applicability of such criteria should be lowered from the current 20 MW to 7,5 MW .
(83) Directive (EU) 2018/2001 strengthened the bioenergy sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions savings 
framewor k by setting criteria for all end-use sector s. It set out specifi c rules for biofuels, bioliquids and biomass 
fuels produced from forest biomass, requir ing the sustainability of harvesting operations and the accounting of 
land-use change emissions. In line with the objectives to preser ve biodiversity and prevent habitat destr uction 
pursuant to Directive 92/43/EEC, Directive 2000/60/EC, Directive 2008/56/EC of the European Parliament and of 
the Council (29)and Directive 2009/147/EC, it is necessar y to achi eve the enhanced protection of especially 
biodiverse and carbon-r ich habitats, such as primar y and old-gro wth forests, highly biodiverse forests, grasslands, 
peat lands and heathlands. Theref ore, excl usions and limitations to the sourcing of forest biomass from those areas 
should be introduced, in line with the approach for biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels produced from 
(29)Directive 2008/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 establishing a framewo rk for community 
action in the field of mar ine environmental policy (Mar ine Strategy Framewo rk Directive) (OJ L 164, 25.6.2008, p. 19).OJ L, 31.10.2023 EN  ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2023/2413/oj 21/77agricultural biomass, exce pt where the risk-based approac h provid es for the necessar y excl usions and limitations and 
operat ors provide the necessar y assurances. In addition, subject to appropr iate transition periods for inve stment 
secur ity purposes, the greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria should also gradually apply to existing biomass- 
based installations to ensure that bioenergy production in all such installations leads to greenhouse gas emission 
reductions compared to energy produced from fossil fuels.
(84) The sustainability criteria concer ning forest biomass harvesting should be further specifi ed, in line with the 
principles of sustainable forest manag ement. Those specifications should aim to strengthen and clarify the risk- 
based approach for forest biomass, while provi ding Member State s with propor tionat e provisions allowing for 
target ed adap tations for practices that can be locally appropr iate.
(85) Member State s should ensure that their use of forest biomass for producing energy is compat ible with their 
oblig ations pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/841 of the European Parliament and of the Council (30). To that end, 
Member State s should conduct forward-looking assessments and imp lement necessar y measures that compl ement 
their oblig ations pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999.
(86) In view of the specific situation of the outermost regions referred to in Article 349 TFEU and character ised in the 
energy sector by isolation, limited supply and dependence on fossil fuels, provis ion should be made to exte nd the 
derogat ion that allows Member States to adopt specifi c criteria in order to ensure eligibility for financia l suppor t for 
the consum ption of certain biomass fuels in those regions to also cover bioliquids and biofuels. Any specifi c criteria 
should be objectively justified on the grounds of energy independence of the outermost region concer ned and of 
ensur ing a smooth transition to the sustainability criteria, the energy efficiency criteria and the greenhouse gas 
emissions saving criteria in the outermost region concer ned in accordance with Directive (EU) 2018/2001.
(87) The Union is committed to improving the environmental, economic and social sustainability of biomass fuel 
production. This Directive is compl ementar y to other Union legislative acts, in particular any legislative act on 
corporate sustainability due diligence which lays down due dilig ence requirements in the value chain with rega rd to 
adverse human rights or environmental impact.
(88) In order to reduce the administrative burden for producers of renewable fuels and recy cled carbon fuels and for 
Member State s, where voluntar y or national schemes have been recognised by the Commission through an 
imp lementing act as giving evidence or providing accurate data regarding compliance with sustainability and 
greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria as well as other requirements laid down in the amending provisions set out 
in this Directive, Member States should accept the results of the certification issued by such sche mes within the 
scope of the Commission’s recognition. In order to reduce the burden on small installations, Member States should 
be able to establish a simplified voluntar y verification mechanis m for installations with a total ther mal input of 
between 7,5 MW and 20 MW .
(89) To mitig ate the risks and better prevent fraud in the supply chains for bioenergy and recy cled carbon fuels, Directive 
(EU) 2018/2001 provid es for valuable additions in term s of transparency , traceability and super vision. In that 
conte xt, the Union database to be set up by the Commission aims at enabling the tracing of liquid and gaseous 
renewable fuels and recy cled carbon fuels. The scope of the database should be exte nded from transpor t to all other 
end-use sectors in whic h such fuels are consumed. Such an extensi on is intended to make a vital contr ibution to the 
compreh ensive monitoring of the production and consump tion of those fuels, mitig ating risks of double-counting 
or irregular ities along the supply chains covered by the Union database. In addition, to avoid any risk of double 
claims on the same renewable gas, a guarant ee of origin issued for any consignment of renewable gas register ed in 
the database should be cancelled. The database should be made publicly available in an open, transparent and user - 
friendly manner , while also respecting the principles of private and commercially sensitive data protection. The 
(30)Regulation (EU) 2018/841 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 on the inclusion of greenhouse gas 
emissions and removals from land use, land use chang e and forestr y in the 2030 climate and energy framework, and amending 
Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 and Decision No 529/2013/EU (OJ L 156, 19.6.2018, p. 1).OJ L, 31.10.2023 EN  ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2023/2413/oj 22/77Commission should publish annual repor ts about the information repor ted in the Union database, including the 
quantities, geographic origin and feedstoc k type of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels. The Commission and 
Member States should endeav our to work on the interconnectivity between the Union database and existing 
national databases, enabling a smooth transition as well as enabling the bi-directionality of the databases. 
Com plementar y to that strengthening of the transparency and the traceability of individual consignments of raw 
mater ials and fuels in the supply chain, recently adopt ed Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/996 (31)
enhanced the requirements on auditing for certification bodies and increased the powers for public super vision of 
certification bodies, including the possibility for compet ent author ities to access documents and premises of 
economic operators in their super visor y controls. The integr ity of the verification framew ork of Directive 
(EU) 2018/2001 has according ly been signif icantly strengthened by complementing the auditing by certification 
bodies and Union database with verification and super visor y capacity of the compet ent author ities of the Member 
State s. It is strong ly recommended that Member States make use of both possibilities for public super vision.
(90) The Commission and the Member State s should continuously adap t to best administrative practices and take all 
appropr iate measures to simplify the implementation of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, and thus reduce compl iance 
costs for involved actors and affected sectors.
(91) Adequate anti-fraud provisions must be laid down, in particular in relation to the use of waste -based raw mater ials or 
of biomass that is identif ied as representing a high indirect land use chang e risk. As the detection and prevention of 
fraud is essential to prevent unfai r competition and rampant deforestation, including in third countr ies, full and 
certified traceability of those raw mat erials should be implemented.
(92) Directive (EU) 2018/2001 should theref ore be amended according ly.
(93) Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 make s several referen ces to the Union-level binding target of at least 32 % for the share 
of renewable energy consumed in the Union in 2030. As that target needs to be increased in order to contr ibute 
effectively to the ambition to decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 55 % by 2030, those referen ces should be 
amended. Any additional planning and repor ting requirements set will not creat e a new planning and repor ting 
system, but should be subject to the existing planning and repor ting framework under that Regulation.
(94) The scope of Directive 98/70/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (32)should be amended in order to 
avoid a duplication of regulatory requirements with regard to transpor t fuel decarbonisation objectives and to align 
with Directive (EU) 2018/2001.
(95) The definitions laid down Directive 98/70/EC should be aligned with those laid down in Directive (EU) 2018/2001 
in order to avoid different definitions being applied pursuant to those two acts.
(96) The obligations regar ding the greenhouse gas emissions reduction and the use of biofuels in Directive 98/70/EC 
should be deleted in order to streamline and avoid double regulation with regar d to the strengthened transpor t fuel 
decarbonisation oblig ations whic h are provided for in Directive (EU) 2018/2001.
(97) The obligations regar ding the monitoring of and repor ting on the greenhouse gas emission reductions set out in 
Directive 98/70/EC should be deleted to avoid duplicating the regulation of repor ting obligations.
(31)Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/996 of 14 June 2022 on rules to verify sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions 
saving criteria and low indirect land-use chang e-risk criteria (OJ L 168, 27.6.2022, p. 1).
(32)Directive 98/70/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 Octo ber 1998 relating to the quality of petrol and diesel fuels 
and amending Council Directive 93/12/EEC (OJ L 350, 28.12.1998, p. 58).OJ L, 31.10.2023 EN  ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2023/2413/oj 23/77(98) Council Directive (EU) 2015/652 (33), whic h provides the detailed rules for the unif orm implementation of Article 7a 
of Directive 98/70/EC, should be repealed as it becomes obsolete with the repeal of Article 7a of Directive 98/70/EC 
by this Directive.
(99) As regards bio-based compo nents in diesel fuel, the referen ce in Directive 98/70/EC to diesel fuel B7, that is diesel 
fuel containing up to 7 % fatty acid meth yl esters (FAME), limits available options to attain higher biofuel 
incor poration targets as set out in Directive (EU) 2018/2001. That is due to the fact that almost the entire Union 
supply of diesel fuel is already B7. For that reason, the maximum share of bio-based compo nents should be 
increased from 7 % to 10 %. Sustaining the mark et uptak e of B10, that is diesel fuel containing up to 10 % FAME, 
requires a Union-wide B7 prot ection grade for 7 % FAME in diesel fuel due to the sizeable propor tion of vehicles 
not compati ble with B10 expect ed to be present in the fleet by 2030. That should be reflected in Article 4(1), 
second subparagraph, of Directive 98/70/EC.
(100) Transitional provisions should allow for an ordered continuation of data collection and the fulfilment of repor ting 
oblig ations with respect to the articles of Directive 98/70/EC delet ed by this Directive.
(101) Since the objectives of this Directive, namely reducing greenhouse gas emissions, energy dependence and energy 
prices, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather , by reasons of the scale of the action, be 
bette r achieve d at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiar ity as set 
out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of propor tionality , as set out in 
that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessar y in order to achieve those objectives.
(102) In accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of 28 Sept ember 2011 of Member State s and the Commission on 
explanato ry documents (34), Member States have under taken to accompan y, in justif ied cases, the notifi cation of 
their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the compo nents of a 
directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instr uments. With regard to this Directive, the 
legislator s consider the transmission of such documents to be justif ied, in particular followi ng the judgment of the 
European Cour t of Justice in Case Commission vs Belgium (35)(case C-543/17).
(103) In order to offset the regulatory burdens introduced by this Directive on citizens, administrations and under takings, 
the Commission should review the regulator y framew ork in the sectors concer ned in line with the ‘one in, one out’ 
principle, as set out in the Commission communication of 29 Apr il 2021 , entitled ‘Better Regulation: Joining forces 
to make better laws’,

assessments refer red to in that paragraph, the compet ent author ities of that Member State shall carry out a screening 
process of projects that are located in dedicat ed infrastr ucture areas. Such a screening process shall be based on 
existing data from the environmental assessment pursuant to Directive 2001/42/EC. The compe tent author ities may 
request the applicant to provide additional available information. The screening process shall be finalised within 30 
days. It shall aim to identify if any of such projects is highly likely to give rise to significant unforeseen adverse effects, 
in view of the environmental sensitivity of the geographical areas where they are locat ed, that were not identif ied 
during the environmental assessment of the plans designating dedicate d infrastr ucture areas carried out pursuant to 
Directive 2001/42/EC and, where relevant, to Directive 92/43/EEC.
4. Where the screening process identif ies a project to be highly likely to give rise to significant unforeseen adverse 
effects as refer red to in paragraph 3, the compe tent author ity shall ensure, on the basis of existing data, that 
appropr iate and propor tionat e mitigation measures are applied to address those effects. Where it is not possible to 
apply such mitig ation measures, the compet ent author ity shall ensure that the operat or adopts appropr iate 
compen satory measures to address those effects, whic h, if other propor tionat e compen satory measures are not 
available, may take the form of a monetar y compensation for species protect ion programmes, in order to ensure or 
improve the conser vation status of the species affect ed.OJ L, 31.10.2023 EN  ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2023/2413/oj 36/775. Where the integration of renewable energy into the electr icity system requires a project to reinf orce the grid 
infrastr ucture in or outside dedicated infrastr ucture areas, and such a project is subject to a screening process carried 
out pursuant to paragraph 3 of this Article, to a determination whether the project requires an environmental impact 
assessment or to an environmental impact assessment pursuant to Article 4 of Directive 2011/92/EU, such a 
screening process, determination or environmental impact assessment shall be limited to the poten tial impact arising 
from the chang e or extensi on compar ed to the original grid infrastr ucture.

applicable law.
Article 16a
Permit-g ranting procedure in renewables acceleration areas
1. Member States shall ensure that the permit-granting procedure refer red to in Article 16(1) shall not exceed 12 
months for renewable energy projects in renewables acceleration areas. However , in the case of offshore renewable 
energy projects, the permit-granting procedure shall not exceed two years. Where duly justif ied on the ground of 
extraordinar y circumstances, Member States may exte nd either of those periods by up to six months. Member States 
shall inform the project developer clearly of the extraordinar y circumstances that justify such an exte nsion.
2. The permit-granting procedure for the repo wering of renewable energy power plants, for new installations with 
an electr ical capacity of less than 150 kW, for co-located energy storag e, including power and ther mal facilities, as 
well as for their grid connection, where located in renewables acceleration areas, shall not exceed six months. 
Howe ver, in the case of offshore wind energy projects, the permit-granting procedure shall not exceed 12 months. OJ L, 31.10.2023 EN  ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2023/2413/oj 38/77Where duly justif ied on the ground of extraordinar y circumstances, such as on grounds of over riding safety reasons 
where the repower ing project has a substantial impact on the grid or on the original capacity , size or perf ormance of 
the installation, Member States may exte nd the six-month period by up to three months and the 12-month period for 
offshore wind energy projects by up to six months. Member States shall inform the project developer clearly about the 
extraordinar y circumstances that justify such an extension.
3. Without prejudice to paragraphs 4 and 5 of this Article, by way of derogation from Article 4(2) of and Annex II, 
points 3(a), (b), (d), (h), (i), and 6(c), alone or in conjunction with point 13(a), to Directive 2011/92/EU, with regard to 
renewable energy projects, new applications for renewable energy plants, including plants combining differ ent types 
of renewable energy technology and the repower ing of renewable energy power plants in designated renewables 
acceleration areas for the relevant technology and co-located energy storag e, as well as the connection of such plants 
and stora ge to the grid, shall be exem pt from the requirement to carry out a dedicate d envi ronmental impact 
assessment pursuant to Article 2(1) of Directive 2011/92/EU, provided that those projects compl y with 
Article 15c(1), point (b), of this Directive. That derog ation shall not apply to projects which are likely to have 
signif icant effects on the environment in another Member State or where a Member State that is likely to be 
signif icantly affect ed so requests, pursuant to Article 7 of Directive 2011/92/EU.
By way of deroga tion from Article 6(3) of Directive 92/43/EEC, the renewable energy plants referred to in the first 
subparagraph of this paragraph, shall not be subject to an assessment of their implications for Natura 2000 sites 
provid ed that those renewable energy projects compl y with the rules and measures established in accordance with 
Article 15c(1), point (b), of this Directive.
4. The compet ent author ities shall carry out a screening process of the applications referred to in paragraph 3 of 
this Article. Such a screening process shall aim to identify if any of the renewable energy projects is highly likely to 
give rise to significant unforeseen adverse effects in view of the environmental sensitivity of the geographical areas 
where they are locat ed, whic h were not identif ied during the environmental assessment of the plans designating 
renewables acceleration areas refer red to in Article 15c(1), first subparagraph, of this Directive carried out pursuant 
to Directive 2001/42/EC and, where relevant, to Directive 92/43/EEC. Such a screening process shall also aim to 
identify if any of such renewable energy projects falls within the scope of Article 7 of Directive 2011/92/EU due to 
its likelihood of signif icant effects on the environment in another Member State or due to the request of a Member 
State whic h is likely to be signif icantly affected.
For the purpose of such a screening process, the project developer shall provide information on the charact eristics of 
the renewable energy project, on its compl iance with the rules and measures identif ied pursuant to Article 15c(1), 
point (b), for the specifi c renewables acceleration area, on any additional measures adopt ed by the project developer , 
and on how those measures address environmental impact. The compet ent author ity may request the project 
developer to provid e additional available information. The screening process relating to applications for new 
renewable energy plants shall be finalised within 45 days from the date of submission of suffi cient information 
necessar y for that purpose. However , in the case of applications for installations with an electr ical capacity of less 
than 150 kW and new applications for the repower ing of renewable energy power plants, the screening process shall 
be finalised within 30 days.
5. Following the screening process, the applications referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article shall be author ised 
from an environmental perspective without requir ing any express decision from the compet ent author ity, unless the 
compet ent author ity adopts an administrative decision, setting out due reasons on the basis of clear evidence, to the 
effect that a specific project is highly likely to give rise to signif icant unforeseen adverse effects in view of the 
environmental sensitivity of the geographical area where the project is locat ed that cannot be mitig ated by the 
measures identified in the plans designating acceleration areas or proposed by the project developer . Such decisions 
shall be made publicly available. Such renewable energy projects shall be subject to an environmental impa ct 
assessment pursuant to Directive 2011/92/EU and, if applicable, to an assessment pursuant to Directive 92/43/EEC, 
which shall be carried out within six months of the administrative decision identifying a high likelihood of 
signif icant unforeseen adverse effects. Where duly justif ied on the grounds of extraordinar y circumstances, that six- 
month period may be extended by up to six months.OJ L, 31.10.2023 EN  ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2023/2413/oj 39/77In the event of justified circumstances, including where needed to accelerate the deplo yment of renewable energy to 
achi eve the climat e and renewable energy targets, Member States may exem pt wind and solar photo voltaic projects 
from such assessments.
Where Member States exem pt wind and solar photo voltaics projects from those assessments, the operat or shall adopt 
propor tionat e mitigation measures or, where such mitig ation measures are not available, compen satory measures, 
which , if other propor tionate compen satory measures are not available, may take the form of monetar y 
compen sation, in order to address any adverse effects. Where those adverse effects have an impact on species 
prote ction, the operator shall pay a monetar y compe nsation for species prote ction programmes for the duration of 
the operation of the renewable energy plant in order to ensure or improve the conser vation status of the species 
affected.
6. In the permit-granting procedure referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, Member State s shall ensure that the lack of 
reply by the relevant compet ent author ities within the established deadline results in the specific interm ediar y 
administrative steps to be considered as approved, excep t where the specific renewable energy project is subject to an 
environmental imp act assessment pursuant to paragraph 5 or where the principle of administrative tacit approval 
does not exist in the national legal system of the Member State concer ned. This paragraph shall not apply to final 
decisions on the outcome of the permit-granting procedure, which shall be explicit. All decisions shall be made 
publicly available.
Article 16b
Permit-g ranting procedure outside renewables acceleration areas
1. Member State s shall ensure that the permit-granting procedure refer red to in Article 16(1) shall not exceed two 
years for renewable energy projects locat ed outside renewables acceleration areas. However , in the case of offshore 
renewable energy projects, the permit-granting procedure shall not exceed three years. Where duly justified on the 
grounds of extraordinar y circumstances, including where they require exte nded periods needed for assessments 
under applicable Union environmental law, Member States may exte nd either of those periods by up to six months. 
Member States shall inform the project developer clearly of the extraordinar y circumstances that justify such an 
extensi on.
2. Where an environmental assessment is required pursuant to Directive 2011/92/EU or 92/43/EEC, it shall be 
carried out in a sing le procedure that combines all relevant assessments for a given renewable energy project. When 
any such environmental impact assessment is required, the compet ent author ity, taking into account the information 
provid ed by the project developer , shall issue an opinion on the scope and level of detail of the information to be 
included by the project developer in the environmental impa ct assessment repor t, of whic h the scope shall not be 
extende d subsequently . Where a renewable energy project has adopt ed necessar y mitigation measures, any killing or 
disturbance of the species protect ed under Article 12(1) of Directive 92/43/EEC and Article 5 of 
Directive 2009/147/EC shall not be considered to be deliberate. Where novel mitig ation measures to prevent as 
much as possible the killing or disturbance of species protect ed under Directives 92/43/EEC and 2009/147/EC, or 
any other environmental impact, have not been widely tested as regar ds their effectiveness, Member States may allow 
their use for one or several pilot projects for a limite d time period, provi ded that the effectiveness of such mitigation 
measures is closely monitore d and appropr iate steps are taken immediately if they do not prove to be effective.
The permit-granting procedure for the repowe ring of renewable energy power plants, for new installations with an 
electr ical capacity of less than 150 kW and for co-located energy storag e, as well as for the connection of such plants, 
installations and storag e to the grid, located outside renewables acceleration areas shall not exceed 12 months, 
including with regard to envi ronmental assessments where required by the relevant law. However , in the case of 
offshore renewable energy projects, the permit-granting procedure shall not exceed two years. Where duly justif ied 
on the ground of extraordinar y circumstances, Member States may extend either of those periods by up to three 
months. Member States shall inform the project developer clearly of the extraordinar y circumstances that justify such 
an extensi on.OJ L, 31.10.2023 EN  ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2023/2413/oj 40/77Article 16c
Acc elerating the permit-g ranting procedure for repo wering
1. Where repower ing of a renewable energy power plant does not result in an increase of the capacity of a 
renewable energy power plant beyond 15 %, and without prejudice to any assessment of pote ntial environmental 
impact required pursuant to paragraph 2, Member State s shall ensure that permit granting procedures for 
connections to the transmission or distr ibution grid shall not exceed three months following application to the 
relevant entity unless there are justif ied safet y concer ns or there is technical incompa tibility of the system 
compo nents.
2. Where the repo wering of a renewable energy power plant is subject to the screening process provid ed for in 
Article 16a(4), to a determination whether the project requires an environmental impact assessment or to an 
environmental impa ct assessment pursuant to Article 4 of Directive 2011/92/EU, such a screening process, 
determination or environmental impact assessment shall be limited to the pote ntial impact arising from a change or 
extensi on compared to the original project.
3. Where the repower ing of solar installations does not entail the use of additional space and compl ies with the 
applicable envi ronmental mitigation measures established for the original solar installation, the project shall be 
exem pt from any applicable requirements to carry out a screening process as provid ed for in Article 16a(4), to 
determine whether the project requires an environmental impact assessment, or to carry out an envi ronmental 
impact assessment pursuant to Article 4 of Directive 2011/92/EU.
Article 16d
Permit-g ranting procedure for the inst allation of solar energy equipment
1. Member State s shall ensure that the permit-granting procedure referred to in Article 16(1) for the installation of 
solar energy equipment and co-located energy storage, including building-int egrated solar installations, in existing or 
future artificial structures, with the exclusion of artificial water surfaces, shall not exceed three months, provided that 
the primar y aim of such artificial structures is not solar energy production or energy storage. By way of derogation 
from Article 4(2) of and Annex II, points 3(a) and (b), alone or in conjunction with point 13(a), to 
Directive 2011/92/EU, such installation of solar equipment shall be exem pt from the requirement, if applicable, to 
carry out a dedicat ed environmental impact assessment pursuant to Article 2(1) of that Directive.
Member States may excl ude certain areas or structures from the application of the first subparagraph for the purpose 
of prote cting cultural or histo rical heritage, national defence interests, or safety reasons.
2. Member State s shall ensure that the permit-granting procedure for the installation of solar energy equipment 
with a capacity of 100 kW or less, including for renewables self-consumers and renewable energy communities, shall 
not excee d one month. The lack of reply by the compe tent author ities or entities within the established deadline 
follo wing the submission of a compl ete application shall result in the permit being considered as granted, provid ed 
that the capacity of the solar energy equipment does not excee d the existing capacity of the connection to the 
distr ibution grid.
Where the application of the capacity threshold referred to in the first subparagraph leads to a signif icant 
administrative burden or to constraints to the operation of the electr icity grid, Member State s may apply a lower 
capacity threshold provided that it remains abov e 10,8 kW.
Article 16e
Permit-g ranting procedure for the inst allation of heat pumps
1. Member State s shall ensure that the permit-granting procedure for the installation of heat pumps below 50 MW
